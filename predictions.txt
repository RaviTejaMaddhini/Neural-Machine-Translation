you know what i do is write for the kids and in fact i am probably the author for kids more read in the united states
and i always tell people i do not want to look like a scientist
i can wear as a farmer or with leather clothes and no one has chosen a farmer
i am here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies
and you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell somewhere
you just have to turn the apple to see it as an epiphany
that is the painting of a circle
a friend of mine did that richard <unk>
it is the kind of complicated circle which i am going to talk about
my circle started in the 60s at the middle school in <unk> ohio where i was the rare of the class
when they are being beaten up to bleed every week in the bathroom bathroom until a teacher saved me
she saved my life by letting me go into the room of teachers
he made it secret
for three years
and i had to go out of the city
i had a thumb and 85 dollars and i ended up in san francisco california found a lover and in the 80s i felt the need to start working in organizations who fought aids
about three or four years ago at night i got a phone call from that teacher mrs <unk> who said i need to see you
i am disillusioned as adults we never got to know to know
you could go to ohio and please bring that man who you have already found
and i have to tell you that i have pancreatic cancer and i would like you to give you this please
well the next day we were in cleveland
we went to see we were laughing wept and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
we found a place the <unk> and we take care of her family because it was necessary
it is something we knew how to do
and so as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult came to me became a box of cinders and he was put in my hands
and what happened was that the circle had closed it had become a circle and that epiphany that i talked about it was done in itself
the epiphany is that death is part of life
she saved my life my partner and i save her
and you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs
it needs truth and beauty and i am very happy that i have talked about this
it also needs dignity love and pleasure and our work will provide those things
thank you
as an artist the connection is very important for me
through my work i am trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected
i first went to antarctica about 10 years ago and there i saw my first <unk>
i was amazed
my heart can fast i was trying to understand what was in front of me
i <unk> myself around the water almost 60 feet and i could not more than thinking it was a snowflake of snow over another snowflake year after year
<unk> are born when we fall from glaciers or break down the ice walls
every iceberg has its own individual personality
they have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences
some of them are refuse to give up and hold on until the end of the end while others can not stand it anymore and they are going into a dramatic passion
it is easy to think about looking at a iceberg that are isolated separated and alone as we see we sometimes as humans
but reality is the opposite
as it melts a iceberg i am breathing an ancestral atmosphere
as it melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life
i get to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these unique moments they exist in that way and they will not be able to exist again
it is not death when you melt it is not an end but a continuation of its way through the life cycle
part of the <unk> ice i photograph is very young it is a couple thousand years
and another part of the ice has over 100,000 years
the last pictures i would like to show you is a iceberg that i photographed in <unk> greenland
it is short to get really to see a rolling iceberg
here they have
you can see on the left a little boat
it is about five feet
and i would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
you can see here it starts to roll the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there
this is a iceberg from the average size iceberg
it is about water about 120 feet or 40 feet
this video is in real time
and so let us talk about the iceberg it shows a different side of his personality
thank you
i want you to imagine two couples in 1979 the same day exactly at the same time every single <unk> a baby
so two couples each one with a baby
i do not want you to get too much in the details of conception because if you stop thinking about conception i am not going to pay attention
let us think about that for a moment
and on this stage i want you to imagine that in one case the chromosome and the sperm joins the x chromosome of the egg
and in the other case the x chromosome of the sperm joins the x chromosome of the egg
both of them go on and start life
we will come back to talk about them later
in my activity i will turn two roles
in one of my roles i work with the history of anatomy
i am an historian by training and what i study in this case is the way people started the anatomy of the anatomy of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids the idea of the body what they have thought about about the body
the other role that performance in my work is an activist as a patients or as i say sometimes welcome people to people who are medical patients
in this case i have worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms
i have been working for example with twins <unk> two people inside the same body
i have worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average
and i have worked with many cases of people with typical sex individuals whose physics physics does not fit into the early male and conventional female schemes
in general lines we can call it <unk>
it takes a lot of shapes
i am going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that is not going to be used in the ordinary forms of male or female forms
for example there is the case of the individual with the <unk> base of the chromosome whose <unk> of the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in the fetal life that we all have in the fetal life
and then in the fetal life the testicles produce testosterone
but because this individual lacks testosterone receptors the body does not react to the same
it is the <unk> <unk> syndrome
so there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction
as a result the body develops following a typically female course
when the baby is born it looks like a child
it is a girl she is raised as a girl
and often it is not until puberty when he is growing and developing breast but it does not have the menstrual cycle when someone realizes something is happening
after doing testing you realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus actually have testicles and a chromosome y
the important thing to understand is that you can think it is a man but it is actually not that
women like men have in the body something called glands <unk>
they are in the back of the body
<unk> glands make <unk> the hormone from <unk>
most women like me i consider myself i consider myself a typical woman does not know her <unk> structure i think a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
we produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
as a consequence somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has the <unk> <unk> syndrome
so sex is something complicated is not that the <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum in some ways they can be everywhere
another example a few years ago i got a call from a 19-year old boy born and raised as a male he had a girlfriend and sex with she was wearing a life like boy and i had just found that i had ovaries and uterus
i had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
i had chromosomes and the uterus <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment
as a result your genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male
he was born as a child nobody suspected nothing
and it was at the age of 19 when it started to have some medical problems caused by internal menstruation when doctors found that in fact was woman inside
well another example quickly from a case of <unk>
some people with chromosomes we develop what is known as <unk> is to say they have tissue <unk> wrapped in a tube
we do not know why that happens
so there are many varieties of sex
the reason that kids with this kind of bodies are likely to be quasi twins <unk> or <unk> they are set up surgery it is not to be able to have some better physical health
in many cases people are perfectly healthy
the reason why they are set up to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories
the system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity
we have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity was supposed to be black he means to have african anatomy in historical terms
a terribly simplistic idea
and when you presented to a body that shows something quite different we have trouble with <unk>
so we have got very romantic ideas in our culture in terms of individualism
our nation is based on a very romantic concept
imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside a same body
the most high high case is last year with the south african <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the trial their sex in the international games in berlin
a lot of journalists called to wonder what test they are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or woman
and i had to explain to you to journalists that there is no such a test
in fact we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does not trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are who we have to draw that line
so what we have is a situation where the more we go through science we have to admit that these categories that we thought were categories of evolutionary pest categories which were gone directly with categories and stable categories are much more <unk> than we thought we thought
and not only in terms of sex
also in terms of race something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows
as we see we go on a rough terrain
let us look for example the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the dna with chimpanzees
what about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few nucleotides
and as we thrive in science we get more and more in an awkward zone where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that are probably too simplistic
and we are looking at this in all walks of human life
one of them for example in our current culture in the united states today are the struggles at first and at the end of life
it is hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
there are very very heated discussions today not in public but i know inside of it when someone is considered dead
our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead
as much as they put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved they still did not buried
if i stopped moving they buried
but today we can for example extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body
and as a consequence we have to deal with the dilemma of determining really the death of somebody and this puts us in a difficult situation where we do not have the simple categories of the past
and maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me
in politics i am progressive with people with unusual bodies but i have to admit that i am nervous
you see these categories are much more fragile than we thought <unk>
<unk> from the concept of view of democracy
and to tell you about this tension first i have to admit that i am a fervent fan of the founding fathers
i know they were racist i know they were <unk> but they were big
i mean they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did i find that musical and i am looking at that musical <unk> and not by the music that is totally <unk>
that is why it happened in 1776 with the founding fathers
the founding fathers were to me the first activists of the anatomy and explain why
what they would not reject was a bit of the reason and they would plug it up with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years
and as everybody remembers what our founding fathers did was the idea of the monarchy monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy
the monarchs of the old world did not know the dna but they had clear the idea of the law of birth
they had the concept of blue blood
they were from the idea that the political power was going to be taken by the law of blood by the father to the father and then the son etc
the founding founding fathers rejected that idea and it would replace it for a new anatomic concept and that concept was that all men are created the same
they <unk> the field of play and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences that was very radical
and partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were happening two things
it was happening democracy and at the same time <unk> science
and it remains very clear if you look at the story of the founding fathers that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a naturalist
they were getting rid of the supernatural explanations and so they would reject the concept of power supernatural being transmitted by a vague entitled right
they were moving into a naturalist
and if you look for example the declaration of independence talk about nature and the god of nature
they do not talk about god and the nature of god
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are
and as a result we were passing the idea of anatomical coincidence
and when they do that they were clearly the foundations of the future civil rights movement
they did not think that way but they did it for us and it was great
and what happened years later
and women succeeded
then the success of the civil rights movement with <unk> <unk> people who said i am not a woman
we found men in the rows of civil rights movement saying i am a man
again people in color who are going to get <unk> on the anatomical amount of anatomical difference and again they succeeded
we see the same thing with the movement of disability
the problem is of course as we look at the coincidences we need to start asking why we keep certain divisions
but attention i want to keep some authoritarian divisions in our culture
for example i do not want to give a fish the same rights to a human
i do not want to say that we had to fight the anatomy
i do not mean that the five year olds were supposed to allow them to have sex or marry
there are some islamic divisions that for me make sense and i think we should keep
but the challenge is to try to figure out what are why they are why to keep them
well let us go back to those two selves at the beginning of this talk
we have two beings both of them in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day
let us imagine that one of them mary was born three months before june 1 1980
henry on the contrary he was born in terms of the march one march
by the only fact that we have been born three months before mary is attributed to all the rights three months before henry the right to sexual consent the right to vote the right to <unk>
henry has to wait for all that not because i have a different biological age but because it was born later
we find other oddities in relation to their rights
henry in virtue of being considered man if well i have not told you if it is <unk> in virtue of being considered man now it is <unk> the mandated <unk> that mary does not have to worry
mary on his part does not have the same rights to marriage henry in all the states for example
henry can get married in every states with a woman but mary can marry a woman in some states
so they are still persist in anatomic categories that in various ways are troubled and questionable
and now the question is what do we do now that science walked around in the field of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could crumble
i do not want to give up science but at the same time sometimes i feel like science gets away
where do we go
it seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude well we have to draw the line somewhere so we are going to do it
but many people have stuck in a rare position
for example texas at the point has decided to marry a man you do not have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have y chromosome
now in practice they do not do tests <unk> people
but this is also very strange given the story that i told you at the beginning of the <unk> <unk> syndrome
if you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king in his speech i have a dream of offers a solution
it says that we should judge people based on not the color of their skin but on the content of their character going beyond the anatomy
and i mean yeah the idea looks very good
but in practice how do you do it
how do you judge people based on the content of their character
i want to point out also that i am not sure we had to do this to give people rights to people because i have to admit that yes of some <unk> golden gate that they probably deserve more social services than some humans i know
i also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that i know can make more decisions intelligent and mature on their sex relationships that people from 40 i know
so how do you put in practice the subject of character content
it is very difficult
and one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could in the future will be measured with an instrument maybe with mri
we really want to get to that point
i am not sure where we go
what i know is that it seems to be very important that the united states continues to run this current of thinking in relation to democracy
we have done a good job in defense of democracy and i think we are going to do a good job in the future
we do not live for example in a context like the iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men it is susceptible to being killed unless he is willing to have a sex change in which case it is allowed to live
we are not in that situation
i am happy to say that we do not have a context like a surgeon that i talked about a couple of years ago that i had done a couple of years to give <unk> twins and then separate their fame
but when the phone was asked the reason for the operation he was a very <unk> operation he told me that in that other country these kids would be very abused and therefore he had to do it
i said well he is considered the political asylum instead of surgical separation
the united states provides huge possibilities to people to be who they are unable to change for the sake of the state
so i think we have to be on the head
well in closing i mean i have been talking a lot about parents
and i want to think about how democracy would be or as it might have been if we had given greater participation to mothers
and i want to say something a little radical for a feminist and that is i think there can be different ideas coming out of different summarized summarized in particular if there are people thinking about group
since years since i have been interested in the <unk> i have also been interested in investigating the sexual difference
and one of the things that i have been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world
and what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average not all but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> inside the group
and if we think about that we have an interesting situation in our hands
years ago when i was in graduate school one of my advisers who knew that i was interested in feminism feminism was considered a feminist as a <unk> made me a strange <unk>
tell me what is the women's feminism thing
and i thought it is the most stupid question i have heard
feminism has to do with undo gender stereotypes so there is nothing female in feminism
but the more i have thought about your question more than there is something female in feminism
i mean there might be something on average something different between the human brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable
so if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the part of the state it is possible to have more mothers to this concept maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with peer support
and maybe that is what we have to do in the future when we have the democracy beyond the anatomy of thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships
so while we try to create a more perfect union let us think about what we are doing each other
thank you
in 2007 i decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development
our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work has the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents
well right now we are far away from that goal
there are billions of people in developing countries who do not count with one city willing to <unk>
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth more than their cost of construction
so easily we could get rid of the world tens maybe hundreds of new cities
well this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities
but just <unk> by apartment buildings
imagine that half of those who wanted to live in in apartments they were already owners and the other half still will not afford to do it
they might try to increase the ability to make expansion in all existing buildings
but you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around us have rules to avoid the discomfort and the distractions of the construction
so it would be very difficult to do all of those expansion
but they could go to a completely new place to build a new apartments building completely new always and when the norms of that place will be built in the place instead of putting it out
so i proposed that governments are going to make new reform zones big enough to contain cities and i gave them a name cities under the charter
later i learned that more or less at the same time <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform honduras
they knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would lose their country to go to the united states and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras
in the summer of 2009 honduras country by a harrowing constitutional crisis
in the next regular elections <unk> wolf they had a platform in which promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation
he asked her to be his head of cabinet
meanwhile i was preparing to give a talk in tedglobal
through a process of inventing trial and error and a lot of testing with users tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under charter to their most essential ideas
the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can not go and upset all the current residents in apartments
we paid a lot of attention to the new technologies but it is needed both of technologies to make progress and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward
in the fall of 2010 a friend of guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the tedtalk
i showed you to <unk>
they called me
they said let me tell the leaders of our country
so in december we met in miami in a conference room of a hotel room
i tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their monetary cost
and i used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like new york notice land that in some cases are worth thousands of dollars per square meter
but it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some time when there was a pause pause said paul maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a charter that specifies the rules that are going on there and an option for people to choose if they want to be or not to live under those norms
so the president of honduras called me and told me that we had to do this project this is important this might be the way for our country forward
he asked me to go to <unk> and i would talk about four and five of january
so i presented another talk full of data which included an image like this which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city this has to be very big
this is a picture in denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver
only this airport covers over 100 square kilometers
so i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city you have to start with a site that is about a place that is about a place that is about 1,000 square miles
that is over 100,000 acres
the whole world <unk> <unk>
the public faces were very serious and attentive
the leader of congress came up to the platform and said professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk but maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk
i have got it here in my computer
so i felt and showed the tedtalk
and this explained how essential a new city can offer new choices for people
there would be a choice of a city that you might be able to be in honduras instead of hundreds of miles away to the north
and they also include new choices for leaders
because leaders of the government of honduras government would need help from countries associated with them could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the rules of the charter so that they could all trust the charter effectively
we went and saw a site
this picture is there
it could easily deal with a thousand square kilometers
and shortly after the 19 of january voted in congress to <unk> their constitution and adding a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development
in a country that i had just passed through this painful crisis voting in congress to favor this constitutional amendment
all of them are parties all the factions in the society that is really really like
for <unk> in the constitution you have to pass twice in congress
february 17 went over again in another voting voting at one
immediately after the vote of 21 to 24 of february a delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in building in the building of cities
one of them is south korea
this is a picture of a new big center of the city which is building in south korea is larger than boston boston
everything you see there was built in four years after it spent four years getting permission
the other country interested in building cities is singapore
in fact they have been built two cities in china and they are preparing for a third
and if you think about this in a practical way this is the point where we are
they have a site and they are already thinking about a site for the second city
they are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to come and have to operate under an external legal system
a country has already committed to allow her supreme court to be the court ultimately for this new justice system
there are urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project
they can even get some of the funding
but the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of people
there are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the americas especially in a place with a free trade zone and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there
in the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to be changed immediately to another place
there is a million a year that comes out of latin america to go to the united states
many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job sometimes they are single mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes
unfortunately sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen in some cases in a decade
so what do you think about building a new city in honduras
or build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world
what do you think about insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents
this is an idea worth spreading
and my friends i was asked to say thank you ted
i am <unk> and this is my <unk>
but before i show you what there is inside i am going to make a public confession and i live in obsessed with suits
i love to find myself wearing and more recently photographing and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different for every time
but i do not buy anything new
all of my clothes is second hand of <unk> markets and retail stores
ah thank you
the second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet
i get to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good because my appearance is unique and buy it becomes my personal search for treasures
i mean what am i going to find today
it is going to be from my size
i will like color
it will cost less than 20 dollars
if all the answers are positive then i feel that i have won
going back to the theme of my <unk> i want to tell you what i packed for this exciting week at ted
i mean what do you bring with someone who has all that clothes
so i am going to show you exactly what i brought
i brought seven pairs of underwear and nothing else
and underwear for exactly a week it is all i have put in my <unk>
i thought it would be able to find everything else that i would like to use after getting here to palm springs
and because i do not know like the woman who walks for ted in underwear that means i found some things
and i would like to show you now the sets for this week
it does not sound interesting
while i do i am also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or i have not learned in this adventure not using new clothing
let us start with sunday
i call this a brilliant tiger tiger
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look good
you can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars
all the whole including the jacket including me it cost me 55 and it is the most expensive i have used in the week
monday color is energy
it is almost physiologically physiologically being of bad humor when you are wearing a bright red pants
if you are happy you are going to attract other people happy
tuesday integration is <unk>
i have spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time
i just know yourself
if you get rid of the right people you do not just understand you too
wednesday <unk> of the child who are wearing inside
sometimes people tell me that it seems to me that i play the <unk> or i remember her little seven year old
i like <unk> and say thank you
thursday trust is the key
if you think you see you well with something it is almost sure you are
and if you think you do not see you well with something it is probably true
my mother taught me this day after day
but it was not until 30 years i really understood their meaning
and i am going to explain it in a few seconds
if you think you are a beautiful person on your inside and outside there is no look you can not attract
so there is no excuse for anyone in this audience
we should be able to achieve everything we want to achieve
thank you
friday one universal truth six words for you the golden <unk> go with everything
and finally saturday develop a personal style of self and unique way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word
i have tried it over and again when people were approaching me this week just so i was using and we had fantastic conversations
obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
so before i went home to brooklyn i am going to give you all
because the lesson that i am trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things
i do not need emotionally emotionally to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another suit crazy colorful and bright and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and i am looking for
thank you very much
thank you
this is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts
the left side which is the logic and the right side which is the intuitive part
so if you are going on a scale to measure the fitness of each hemisphere we could design a blueprint for our brain
for example this would be somebody who is completely logical
this would be somebody who is totally intuitive
so where do you get your brain on this scale
some <unk> by one of these extremes but i think for most of the members of this audience your brain is something like this with a big drone in both hemispheres at the same time
it is not that they are mutually exclusive
can you be logical and intuitive
i consider myself one of those people that just like most other quantum quantum physicists we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas
but at the same time we need a lot of intuition to make experiments work
how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with things
we have to play with them and then we see how they react and then we developed our intuition from that point
and actually you do the same thing
some kind of intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at the time
i mean it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time but you were not born with this notion they developed
i remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar
it was a little kid and he did not really well they would always fell off
but i bet the playing with that parking bar i taught him a valuable lesson and that is that the big things do not allow them to do it and stay in a place
this is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world except you are a particle physicist
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they do not play parking lot play with these strange little particles
and when they play with their particles they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things like they can cross walls or they can be in two different places at the same time
and then they wrote all these observations and they called the quantum mechanics theory
at that point it was the physics a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles
but you did not need them to describe the big objects around us every day
that did not fit very well to my intuition and maybe it is because not very often with particles
well sometimes i play with them but not much
and i have never seen them
i mean no one saw a particle
but they did not fit well to my logic
because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics then it should not be on the principles of quantum mechanics
i do not find the reason why it should not
and therefore i would feel much better if i could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics
that is why a few years ago i proposed to do exactly that
and i did
this is the first object that you can see that it is been in an overlap of quantum mechanics
what we see here is a little computer chip
and you can try to see the green dot right in the middle
that is the little bit of metal i am going to talk about in a minute
this is a picture of the object
and here i am going to zoom in a little bit it is just at the center
and then here we make a really good approach to the small metal metal
what we see is a little bit of metal with a springboard and it is pushing up on a platform
and so i did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip
i went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and i started working all the big machines for about 100 hours
for the last material i had to build my own machine to make this hole in a <unk> form of swimming that is under the device
this device has the ability to be in quantum overlap but for it it needs a little bit of help
let me make an analogy
you know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people
i mean when i am on an elevator i am just doing all sorts of weird things but then when other people go up i will stop doing those things because i do not want to bother you or actually frightening
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way
the trip of inanimate objects are not just people it is the light that shines it and the wind that goes next to the side and the heat of the room
so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics we would have to throw out all the other passengers
and that is what we did
we went off the lights then we introduced a roomba and we pulled all the air and then you cool it to a temperature of less than a degree above zero
now when you are just on the elevator the tiny piece of metal is free to act like it wants
so we measured their movements
we found that it moved in very strange ways
instead of staying perfectly still i was vibrating and the way that you would say it was like a breath in this way like a bellows that expands and contract
and by giving it a soft lift we could make it <unk> and not to go at the same time something that is only happening with quantum mechanics
so what i am telling you is something really fantastic
what does it mean that one <unk> thing and you do not go at the same time
let us think of atoms
in one case all of the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down
it is just in certain <unk> when those line line
in the rest of the time they are <unk>
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which means that all the metal piece is in two different places
i think this is great
really
it was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years because look at this the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal it is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you
so if one atom only can be in two different places at the same time and that piece of metal can be in two different places why do not you too
i mean it is my logic which talks
so imagine if you were in various places at the same time how would that be
how did your consciousness act if your body was <unk> in space
there is another part of the story
and it is when we heat it and we turned the lights down and we looked inside the box we saw that the metal went on there in a single piece
and i could get to this new intuition apparently all the objects on the elevator actually only quantum objects that are just close to a small space
you hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected
well that is not so true
it is more profound than that
that is that those connections your connections to all the things that surround you literally define who you are and that is the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics
thank you
my name is <unk>
and 18 months ago i was doing another job on google until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and he allowed me to do it
it took me 18 months
a lot of negotiations and stories i assure 17 museums very interesting museums
but i am going to focus on the demo
there is a lot of stories of why we did
i think my own story is explains by this slide and this is the access
i grew up in india
i am sure of a great education i am not going to tell you but i did not have access to many of these museums and art works
so when i started traveling and go to museums i started to learn a lot
and working on google attempt to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology
so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing it
so better than a demo and then i will explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from his launch
so we just go to <unk>
look around all the museums there
it is the <unk> gallery at moma <unk> <unk> <unk>
in fact i am going to enter one of my favorites at <unk> the art museum in new york
there are two ways that are very simple
we click and pam we are inside of the museum
no matter where they are bombay or <unk> that actually does not matter
you move around and they have fun
they want to navigate the museum
we open up the plane up and with one click we jumped inside
they are inside you want to go to the end of the hall
go forward to go forward
exploring
thank you but i have not come to the best
now i am in front of one of my favorite paintings the <unk> of pieter <unk> in the <unk>
i see the sign
if the museum shows us the image we click there
look this is one of the images
so here is all the metadata
for those of you who are really interested in art you can click there but i am going to click here right now
and this is one of the images we have captured what we call the <unk> technology
so this image for example contains i think about 10,000 missing million pixels
and there are a lot of people who ask me and what do you get with 10,000 <unk>
so i am going to show you what you can actually get with 10,000 <unk>
you can zoom in in a very simple way
you see fun things that are happening
i love this guy his expression does not have a price
but if you really want to dive into it
so i started playing and i found something that was going on there
and i said a moment this seems interesting
i walked into and i discovered that kids were actually playing something
i did a little research i talked to some people from the <unk> and i actually discovered that this is a game called incomprehensible to hit a stick with a stick on tuesday tuesday
and apparently it was very popular
i do not know why they did but i have learned something about it
and now we are going to get deeper and deeper and you will see that you can actually get to the cracks
now just to give you a little bit of perspective i am going to remove the image so you will see what there is
this is where we were and this is the painting
the best is for coming a second
so now we are going to quickly jump over at moma in new york
here's another one of my favorites the night <unk>
the example i showed was to find details
but what if you want to see the <unk>
and if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece
it goes up and really it gets it
i am going to one of my favorite parts in this picture and i am really going to get to the cracks
this is the night i think i would never seen that before
i am going to show you another one of my favorite function
there is a lot more things here but i do not have time to show it
this is the really cool part it is called collections
all of you absolutely all does not matter whether you are rich or poor or if you have a mansion that gives you the same
you can online to create their own museum to create their own collection from all these images
it is very simple we come in i have created this function that i call the power of the zooming we just made a zoom around
it is about the ambassadors at the national gallery in london
you can write things up to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel when you feel at these masterpieces
so in conclusion i think for me the main thing is that all incredible things do not really come from google
not in my opinion they do not come from museums
maybe i should not say this
they actually come from those artists
and that has been my humble experience with this
i mean i hope that in this digital medium do justice to their artwork and it is represented properly online
and the great question i am doing today is you did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum
and the answer is no
it is to supplement the experience
and that is all thank you
thank you
good evening to all
i have got something to show you
think it is a pixel a flying pixel
in our lab we call it sensitive design
i am going to tell you a little bit about this
if you look at this picture i am from italian origin all the kids in italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in formula careers one in the last two decades
now some time ago if you wanted to win a formula for formula 1 i would take a budget and you would put it to a good pilot and a good car
and if the car and the pilot was good enough you would win the race
this is what we are in engineering the real time control system
it is essentially a system that has two components a sensor and a <unk>
now what is interesting is that the real time systems are starting to get into our lives
our cities in the last few years have been covered with networks and electronics
they are going back computers to open air
and as you are starting to respond differently and they can be detected and <unk>
cities is a big thing
as a note besides i wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the world's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population
75 percent of the energy consumption and to 80 percent of the co2 emissions
if we could do something with cities it would be a big thing
beyond cities all of these detections and <unk> are entering our everyday objects
this is from an exhibition from stuxnet <unk> for late year at moma during the summer
it is called an uncle telling me
well our objects the environment start to speak
in a way it is like almost all the atoms they were turning sensors and actuators
and that is completely changing the interaction that as humans we have with the outside environment
in some sense it is almost like the old dream of michelangelo
you know when michelangelo carved the moses he says he took the hammer and he threw it up in the moses you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said screaming <unk> <unk> why do not you talk
well today for the first time our environment starts to speak to us
and i am going to show you just a few examples <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and release something
let us start with detection
the first project i wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab
this was four and a half years ago in italy
it was a summer hopefully 2006
it was the year where italy won the world cup
maybe some of you remember it they would play italy and france and at the end he gave the <unk>
and anyway at the end i won italy
now let us look at what happened that day looking at activity happening in the network
here we see the city
you see the coliseum in the middle and the <unk> river
it is the morning before the game
the timeline is at the top
in the evening there are people here and there doing calls moving
it starts the game silence
i am going to meet in france from france from italy
<unk> people do a quick call and it goes to the bathroom
second time end of time
first extra time second
they <unk> and at a moment the <unk>
he wins italy yeah
that night everybody went to celebrate the center
there you see the big peak
the next day everybody went to the center to the meeting of the winning team and the prime minister of so
and then everybody came down
you see the picture of the place called circus circus where since the roman day people are going to celebrate it is a big party you can see the peak at the end of the day
this is just an example of how today you can measure the city pulse in a way that we would not have been able to do just a few years ago
another quick example of detection is not about people but things we use and consume and consume
today we know everything about the background of our objects
this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a mac how do you assemble it
but we know very little about where things go
so in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash on its shift by the system
we started with some volunteers who helped us in seattle a little more than a year ago to tag what they were throwing different kinds of things as you can see things that anyway <unk>
and then we put a little chip on the trash and then we started <unk>
these are the results
from seattle
after a week
with this information we realized that there is lots of inefficiencies in the system
we can do the same with much less energy
these are data that did not exist
they are happening complicated things and there is plenty of unnecessary transportation
but the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> does not disappear there is still somewhere on the planet
that if the plastic bottle that i hit one day still goes there
that if we show that to people then we can promote some change of behavior
that was the reason for the project
my colleague at mit <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that but i wanted to go to the second part we talked about the beginning which is push on the environment
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
it all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that spain and south of europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture
and the question was how can technology new technology join that
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit in a workshop was imagine you have got a cao and valves from <unk> <unk> that opens up and closing
it is created as a curtain of water with <unk> water
if you fall the pixels you can write in them to show patterns images text images
and when you zoom in the curtain will open so that we can move as you see in the image
we introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
he liked it a lot
and i design a commission to design the opening of the expo
we call it the digital water pavilion
the whole building is made of water
no doors no windows but when you come up it is open to that you can go
the roof is also covered in water
and if there is a little wind if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof
or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like in this case
those days there will always be somebody in the winter when you go down the roof someone who was there and he said <unk> the building
no it is not that they are demolished but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away
this is how it works
you see people <unk> so it goes inside
and here i am myself trying not to get wet by testing the sensors that open the water
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working
that night was actually even more fun
all the <unk> children came to the building because the way we interact there was a little bit
it was not a building that was going to open up to leave you but a building that kept making slices and water holes and you had to jump to not get wet
noise of people and for us that was really interesting because as architects engineers designers we always think about use people to give our designs
but then reality is always unpredictable
and that is the beauty of doing things to interact that people use
this is an image of the building with the pixels the pixels of water and the projections of them
and this is what led us to think about the next project i am going to show you
imagine that those pixels could start to fly
imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space
this is the video
imagine a helicopter as we saw before it moves with others in sync
we could form this cloud
a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions
or normal but in three dimensions that what changes is the light not the position of the pixels
you can play with a different guy
imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes in different types of resolution
and then all of that could be a <unk> <unk> cloud where you can zoom in and see from very different angles
this is the real <unk> controlled going down to form a v like before
when you turn light you see this the same thing we saw before
imagine each of them controlled by one person
we can have each pixel with a input that comes from people from the movement of people and so on and so on
i want to show you something for the first time
we have been working on campaigning <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of mine today the <unk> star of new york and from la scala scala to capture their 3d movements and use it as input for the <unk>
here we can see brooklyn dancing
on the left see the pixels capture it in different resolutions
it is very much 3d digitization in real time as motion capture
it can spread all the movement
you can go all the way
and once we have the pixels we can play with them with color and movement with gravity and rotation
we want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on
it is something for the london olympics
it is called the cloud
and the idea is imagine again that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment like a <unk> farm as a <unk> farm but with a cloud
imagine that we could do that we would all be able to do a little bit of for a pixel
and i think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that in the last two decades we went from the physical world to the digital world
we have digitized everything as knowledge and it is accessible through the internet
today for the first time and the obama campaign we can put it out we can move from the digital world of self organizing power networks to the physical world
in our case this may be used to design and make a symbol
that would mean something built in a city
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today think about climate change or co2 emissions how to move from the digital world to the physical world
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together collectively
the cloud is a cloud of new <unk> made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles
and those particles are water whereas in our cloud are pixels
it is a physical structure in london but covered
you can move around having different experiences
you can see it from the bottom to share the main moments of the 2012 olympics of 2012 and even more and it can be used as a form of connection with the community
so it is a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up as a new top of london
you can go in there
as if it was a new digital beacon at night but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top
thank you
would you like to be better than they are
suppose i told you that with only about changes in your genes they might improve memory for a more accurate more accurate and faster
or maybe you would like to be in better ways to be stronger having more resistance
they would like to be more attractive and certain of themselves
what about living more with good health
or maybe they are from those people who always wanted to be more creative
what else would you like
what would you like if you could choose something
audience member creativity creativity
how many people would i choose creativity
raise your hand let me see
a few probably had to have the number of creative creative people
that is really good
how many would you choose memory
a few more
and the physical state
a little less
how about longevity
so most of that makes me feel very well as a doctor
if you could have some of this the world would be very different
it is just imagination
or may it be possible
evolution has been a theme here at the ted conference but today i want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject
the great geneticist in the 20th century <unk> <unk> who besides <unk> in the russian orthodox church wrote an essay called nothing in biology makes sense except to the light of evolution
but if you actually accept biological evolution consider this it is just about the past or the future
it refers to others or us
this is another look at the tree of life
the human part of this branch right at a extreme is clear that we are most interested in
<unk> from a common ancestry with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago
in the interval there have been maybe 20 25 different species of hominids
some of them have gone
we have been here about <unk> years
it might seem like we are far away from other parts of this tree of life but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same
you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes
this is not like insulin insulin but it is the same rational protein that comes out of the pancreas
and talking about bacteria you realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body
maybe 10 times more
i mean think of when antonio <unk> you got it in the image of the computer you think about bacteria
the gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria
it is warm dark wet it is very welcoming
and we are going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want without effort from their part
it is really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush to the exit
but for the other we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life
they help digest essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases
but what is the future
we are in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species
or meant to become something different something maybe better adapted to the environment
in this vast symphony <unk> of the universe life on earth is just like a brief compass the animal kingdom as one single single single <unk> and the human life a little bit of grace
that was us
and it was also the fun part of this talk so i hope they have enjoyed it
when i was talking to college i had my first kind of biology
i was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology
i fell in love with the power of evolution and i realized something fundamental to most of the existence of life in the cell organisms each cell just divide and all the genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells
but when organisms appear things they start to change
it enters the visual reproduction
and something really important with the emergence of sexual reproduction passing the genome the rest of the body becomes <unk>
in fact you might say that the inevitability of death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction
i have to confess to you that when i was a college student i thought well sex death sex death death death it seemed pretty reasonable at that time but with every year that happened every time i had more doubt
i got to understand the feelings of george burns who was still in vegas well in his 90s
and one night someone hits your hotel door
he opens the door
in front of him you find a magnificent dancer of clothes
he looks at it and he says i came to look for a sex soup
it is okay he says george i chose the soup
i realized as a physician i was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution not necessarily counterintuitive
i was trying to preserve the body
i wanted to be healthy
i wanted to recover health in the disease
i wanted you to live more and more healthy
evolution is about passing the genome to the next generation adapting and <unk> generation after generation
from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic charge to the next level and then let us leave the sea
i think we would all understand the feeling that woody allen when he said i do not want to achieve immortality through my work
i want to do it not dying
evolution does not necessarily have longevity
it is not necessarily the bigger or stronger or faster or faster and even more intelligent
evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment
that is the only test of survival and success
in the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would produce if there were fish there is a vacuum in the void yet they have managed to do that a welcoming environment
so what does this mean when we look at what is happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular if you look forward to the next phase i would say there is a lot of possibilities
the first is that they do not stop
we have reached a kind of balance
and the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine first we have learned to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and wiped out of the population
and secondly as a species we have made our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to him
and by the way we migrated to <unk> and we are going to become so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution is happening
a second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional natural type of natural form by the forces of nature
and the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly but they are <unk>
and in terms of isolation when as a kind of <unk> planets there are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally
but there is a third possibility an attractive compelling possibility
i call the neo evolution of evolution the new evolution that is not just natural but it is and it is and it is and it is and the individuals in the decisions we will make
now how could this happen
how could we get to do this
first consider the reality that many people today in some cultures are making decisions about their offspring
in some cultures they are choosing to have more male than women
it is not necessarily a good thing for society but it is what you choose to the individual and family level
think also that if anything were possible to be able to choose not only sex of their offspring but in your own body making genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease
and if we could do genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer's or reducing the risk of cancer or eliminate the stroke
they would not want to do those changes in your genes
if you look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible
the human genome project started in 1990 and she took 13 years old
it cost <unk> million dollars
the next year i was finished in 2004 i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three four months
today you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a nearby cost to 20,000 and on a week
it is not a lot to make the human genome for 1,000 and getting more and more in the scope of everyone
they come from those changes
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves but they are going to induce other viruses
believe it or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine in a tobacco plant
you can imagine something good that we can get out of tobacco
that is reality today and in the future it is going to be increasingly possible
imagine then only other two little changes
they can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their offspring
and if they could change sperm and eggs or changing the <unk> egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life eliminate diabetes eliminate the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer
who does not want healthier children
and then that same analytical technology that same engine of science which can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also take a lot of hyper capacities a better memory
why do not you have the ingenuity of a ken jennings especially if you could get it with the next generation of the machine watson
why do not you have a faster twitch that allowed us to run faster and further
why not live longer
this is going to be irresistible
and when we are in conditions of passing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want we would become the evolution of before in the neocortex
we are going to take a process that would normally be 100 thousand years old and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years
these are choices that your grandchildren or the grandchildren of their grandchildren are going to have them
we are going to use these choices in making a better more successful society more considered
or we are going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others
we are going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more maneuverable
this is the kind of question we are going to have to face
and the deepest thing about everything we are going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions wisely
for good or bad and before what you might think of these choices are going to depend on us
thank you
imagine a big bang when you are at 900 feet tall
imagine an airplane full of smoke
imagine a motor <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds frightening
well i had a single seat that day i was sitting in the <unk>
it was the only one i could talk to the flight assistants
so i immediately looked at it and they said no problem you probably slam some birds
and the pilot had already taken off the plane and we were not so far
you could see manhattan
two minutes later three things happened at the same time
the pilot <unk> the plane with the hudson river
usually that is not the route
it turned out the motors
imagine being on an airplane and no noises
and then he said three words
the three words i have ever heard
he said prepare for the impact
i did not have to talk more with the flight assistant
i could see it in his eyes
it was terror life was finished
i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day
i learned that everything changes in a moment
we have this list of things to do before they die these things that we want to do in life and i thought all of the people i wanted to get and i did not do it all the fences i wanted to repair all the experiences that i wanted to have and i never had
while i was thinking about that i am going to come up a phrase which is a bad wine i collect bad wine
because if the wine is ready and the person is there i am going to open it up
i do not want to do anything in life
and that urgency that purpose is really changed my life
the second thing i learned that day and this is while <unk> the george washington bridge which was not so i thought about wow i really feel a big deal
i have lived a good life
in my humanity and my mistakes i have tried to improve everything i did
but in my humanity i also d place to my ego
and i am sorry the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people who matter
and i thought about my relationship with my wife with my friends with people
and then as i did that i decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life
it is not perfect but it is much better
in two years i have not had a fight with my wife
it feels like wonders
i do not try to be right i choose to be happy
the third thing i learned and this is kind of like your mental clock goes down 15 14 13
you see the water <unk>
i am saying please fly
i do not want this to play in 20 pieces as you see in those documentaries
and while i was able to get the sensation of wow it will not be afraid
it is almost like we have been messing out for it all of our life
but it was very sad
i did not want to go i love my life
and that sadness <unk> in a single thought that is just a wish one thing
i wish i could see my children growing up
a month later i was in a performance performance in my first degree not much artistic talent still and scream cry like a small one
and to me that was the whole reason to be in the world
at that point i understood by connecting those two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father
all over the only goal i have in life is to be a good father
i was awarded a miracle not to die that day
and i was awarded another gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and go back in another way
you are flying in today the challenge to imagine that the same thing is going on in your plane and please do not but imagine and how to change
what do you do you are still expecting to do because they think they are going to live forever
how would your relationships change and the negative energy in them
and most importantly they are being the best parents who can
thank you
clearly i have been blessed in life with many amazing projects
but the most cool thing i worked on was for this guy
the guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 80s
one day he came to his house after running and he said dad i am sorry
and that was the beginning of als
today <unk> has a total paralysis
it can only use your eyes
his work influenced me
i have a design design and animation company so obviously graffiti is something intricate that we admire and respect in the world of art
so we decided that we were going to fund tony <unk> and the because
so i went and met with his brother and her father and i said we are going to give you this money
what are you going to do with it
and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me
and i said a second one is not that i saw stephen <unk> who is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices
and he said no unless you be somebody important and you have a good good you can not actually do it
these devices are not affordable for people
and i said well how do you communicate
did anybody see the film the scuba and the butterfly
they communicate in that way they are going to stick with your finger
i said that is archaic how can it be
so i presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that i did not have the least idea of how i was going to cover
i committed to his brother and his father there at that very very very good time this is the deal tony is going to talk we are going to build a machine and we are going to find a way to make her art again
because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much inside you can not communicate
so i talked about a conference a couple months later
i met these guys called <unk> media lab lab that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer they draw on that and register the negative space
so they go out there doing art facilities like this
all the things that appear they say are part of a cycle of life
first they start with sexual organs then with the bad words later with the bush attacks and ultimately people start doing art
but there was always a cycle of life in his presentations
and so he started the journey
and about two years later about a year later after a lot of organization and a lot to move things back on one side we had achieved a couple of things
one touch to the door of insurance companies and we got a machine to make it to be able to communicate a machine like stephen hawking
which was great
and seriously it is the most fun i call it <unk> because when i am talking to the guy you get an email from him and you say i do not deserve this this guy is fantastic
the other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> of all of the <unk> <unk> to our house
my wife children and i moved to the garage from the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> take the control of the house
many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when <unk> would have taken the frames of the walls and in their place there would be graffiti
but for two weeks we have been going to take the sea ride in venice my son was part of my dog and we created this
it is called <unk> <unk> and you can see the description
they are a pair of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the ocean ride in venice beach some of the copper wire and things from home <unk> and radio
we took a <unk> camera we opened it up we put it on a light of led light and now there is a device that is free and it builds yourself we published the code <unk> the software goes down in a free way
and we created a device that has no limitation at all
there is no insurance company to say no
there are no hospital i can say no
anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes
thank you
thank you so much to you that was awesome
so at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room
i love this picture because this is the room of another person and that is his room
there was all this <unk> and <unk> during the grand opening
and then more than a year of planning two weeks of programming intense overnight tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years
and this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it is looking through the support system of his life
we ran the bed so i could see
and we put a projector on a wall of the parking parking park
and he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot
the funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot so we feel as if we were <unk> graffiti
at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was telling us this was the first time i was drawing in seven years
i felt like i would have been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and take me out there so i could breathe
it is not wonderful
in some way that is our war scream
that is what keeps us in movement developing
and we have a long way to go with this
it is a great device but it is the equivalent of a magic screen
someone with this artistic potential deserves much more
so we are trying to figure out how to make it better and make it faster and robust
since then we have had all kinds of recognition
we have won a lot of awards
remember it is free none of us is making money with this
everything comes out of our own pockets
the prizes were like oh this is fantastic
armstrong tweeted something about us and then in december time the time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 and it was really great
the best of all of this and this is what ends up in closing the <unk> is that in april of this year in the <unk> in the l.a center there is going to be an exhibition called art on the streets
and art on the streets is going to have the best <unk> of urban art <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive
so basically this is my idea if you see something that is not possible to do it possible
none of what there is in this room was possible the computer the microphone the microphone nothing was possible at a certain time
do it possible anything in this room
i am not a programmer i never did anything with eye recognition technology i just recognized something and i am going to tell you with wonderful people in order to make it happen
and these are the questions that i want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like you have to do if it is not when and if i am not who if i am that
thank you guys
i have spent the last few years to go into situations usually very difficult and at the same time very much dangerous
i went to the hard prison
i worked in a dangerous carbon mine
i film in a lot of difficult and dangerous war
and i spent 30 days eating just this fun at the beginning a very dangerous medium in the middle of the end
in fact in a lot of my career i have been <unk> in situations looking horrible in the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that <unk> interesting interesting and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you look good and accessible to the audience
so when i knew i was going to come here to make a tedtalk about the world of brands and i wanted to do something a little bit different
so some of you may have heard it or not a couple of weeks ago i took a notice on ebay
i sent some messages on facebook some on twitter i volunteered for the name of my tedtalk in 2011
what i had was the next here his name presents my tedtalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content i could take it in the face especially if i put it in ridicule of you or your company
but said this is a very good media opportunity
you know how many people look at these tedtalks
a lot
it is a degree on progress by the way
so even with that <unk> i knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name
if you would have asked me a year ago i would not have been able to tell them with certainty
but in the new film i am working on looking at the world of marketing marketing
and as i said earlier i have been involved in horrible situations over the last few years but nothing could prepare me for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys
you see i had this idea for a movie
morgan <unk> i want to do a film which tries to do the <unk> of products marketing and advertising and that all of the film is driven with <unk> of marketing and advertising
the film is going to be called the biggest film ever
what happens in the most big movie ever sold is that everything up at the bottom of the beginning has pictures of brand all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title the x mark
now this brand <unk> <unk> the <unk> center
these people would be taken into the film for always always
and so the film explores all this idea michael <unk> it is called mk it is called mk forever
i am one guy who is called mk i am just saying it was more on emphasis
it was in order forever
but we are not just going to have the sponsor of the x mark on the title but we are going to make sure that we are going to get all the categories that we could in the film
maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the coolest shoe you have used
the most cool car that you have driven in the larger film never sold the best drink than you had drunk from the largest film
<unk> <unk> the idea is then besides showing the brands as part of the life making them <unk> the film more to make the film more and actually show the whole process of how it works
the goal of the film is transparency
you are going to see the whole process in this movie
that is the whole idea all the film in principle
and i would love to help you help make it happen
robert friedman you know it is funny because it is the first time i hear that is the maximum respect for the audience
guy i do not know how responsive it is going to be people
<unk> you have a perspective i do not know if angle it is very <unk> but you know how it is going to make an idea david <unk> how much money you need to do this
plus a million and a half dc john kamen i think it is going to be hard the meeting with them but it is certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands
<unk> who knows maybe for the moment it comes out the movie let us look at it as a lot of fun idiots
more what do you think is going to be the answer
and stuart <unk> most of the answers will be not
but it is going to be hard to sell for the film or i am
jk both
it means you are not very optimistic
so i need help
mk i can help
ms mk well awesome
mk we have to think about what brands
ms mk that is the challenge when you look at the people you have to treat
mk we have some places where you go more well off the camera
i thought it turns off the camera it meant we have a conversation out of microphone
it turns out the camera means we do not want to know anything about your movie
more and so it was one of these companies suddenly disappeared
no one wanted to have anything to do with this movie
i was surprised
they did not want to know anything with this project
and i was very impressed i thought the concept of advertising was to present to you the product as many people as it could be able to make so many people i saw it as possible
especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the masses
no that was what i thought
but the problem was you see that my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this
in fact there was not such a mistake
there was no mistake at all
this would have been right
but the problem was what this image represents
see when you are looking for images of transparency in google this is one of the first pictures that appear
i like your way to roll sergey brin no
this was the problem for free simulation of simulation or easily easily detected or seen easily understandable which is characterized by the visibility or access to information about all in business practice being the last line maybe the biggest problem
you see we hear a lot about transparency in these days
our politicians name the president the name would even ignore the ceos
but suddenly when it comes to making it really something changes suddenly
but why well transparency gives you fear like that weird bear that is still left
it is unpredictable like this rare road
and it is also very risky
what else is it is risky
eating a whole cool bowl of cool <unk>
that is very risky
when i started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said we do not want to tell a story
we want to tell a story but tell our story
see when i was a kid and my father caught me in some lie and there he is he staring at me as <unk> he said son there are three sides in every story
there is your story there is my story and it is real history
as you see in this film we wanted to tell real history
but with just a company an agency actually wanting to help me and that just because i knew john bond and richard <unk> from many years i realized that i would have to go on my own he would have to take off the middle and go to business myself with all my team
so what i started to figure out all of a sudden which i started to give you is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem
more i have friends who do big big giant films and others who make films small independent like mine
and my friends who make films of hollywood big giants say that the reason their movies are so successful it is due to the brands that are associated with
and then my friends who make independent films they say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant films of hollywood
and the film is called the largest film ever
how are we going to see specifically to ban in the movie
every time i am going to get out every time i open my <unk> you will see the wines ban
at any time during an interview with somebody i can say are you cool for this interview
you are ready you see a little bit nervous
i want to help you to help you
maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview
and there he is going to give you one of these great pile
so much fusion as the winds of paradise is going to have their opportunity
we are going to have so much for man as a solid woman to <unk> on bar as it is
that is the general look
now i can answer her questions and give you a look at them
soldiers frank are a small brand
similar to the kind of smaller movies that you have made is more well a rival brand
so we do not have the budget that have other brands
so doing things like this you know remind people are the reason why we are interested in
more what words would they use to describe to ban ban
ban it is blank
kf that is a big question
woman technology
more technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
man we are talking about something bold cool
i think cool is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus combat smell and sweat
you keep it cool
how do we keep you fresh more time with better freshness the most cool sizes three times
things like those who highlight the benefits
and that is a multi billion company
what about me what about a common type
i need to talk to the man from the street to people like me to ordinary <unk>
they have to talk to me about my brand
more how do they define your brand
man oh my brand
i do not know
i like good clothes
woman revive the 80s <unk> punk unless it is day of laundry
more good what is the <unk> brand
<unk> one more unique man i guess the kind of gender the style i have to be like a dark glamour
i like the dark colors a lot of gray colors and things like that
usually i have been like sunglasses or i like the crystals and similar
woman if you give out a brand i could be a classic classic mercedes benz
man 2 the brand i am called casual flight
woman 2 in part of a hippie part of <unk> in part girl brooklyn i do not know
man 3 i am the kind of pets
i sell toys for pets in the country and in the world
so i guess that is my brand
in my small sector that is my brand
man 4 my brand is fedex because they digest the commodities
man five brand writer a failure
is that something
lawyer i am a lawyer
tom i am tom
more well we can not all be brand tom but often i am going to get myself into the intersection of dark glamour and a casual flight
i realized i needed an expert
i needed someone who could go into my head someone who could help me understand what they call the brand personality
and i found a company called olson <unk> in pittsburgh
they helped companies like <unk> <unk> hallmark to discover that personality personality
if they could do it for them surely they could do it for me
<unk> <unk> the pictures right
more yes the first picture is a familiar picture
now tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be
more these people shape my way to see the world
to tell me about that world
more that world i think your world is the world in which you live as your friends your family the way you live in your life the work you do
all of those things come from and start in a place and in my case they come and start in my family in west virginia
what is the next one you want to talk about
the next is this was the best day of my life
what does this relate to your thoughts feelings and your way to be
it is like who i would like to be me
i like different things
i like weird things i like weird things
so to tell me about why what is that for us
what is the machete in which you are going to find you now
why is it important to reset what is the red
tell me a little bit about that
a little more of you who are not who you are
what else have you had
it does not have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster you are
ms <unk> thank you
thank you for your patience more big work i know more thank you very much
i do not know what is going to come out of this
there was a lot of madness
<unk> <unk> the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides but complementary in your brand personality mark morgan <unk> is a conscious playful brand
they were very good together
and i think there is almost a paradox in them
and i think a few companies will only be used in one of their strong spots or on the other instead of focusing on both
many companies tend and it is nature <unk> to avoid the things that they are not safe to avoid fear those elements and you are actually going to sink and make it become positive for you and it is nice to see that
what other brands are like this
the first here is the classic apple
and you can also see here at a very wii mini mini <unk> and <unk>
now there are playful brands and brands conscious those things that have gone and come but a conscious playful brand is something rather powerful
more playful brand what is your brand
if someone asks you to do your identity of brand your brand personality what would it be
you are a bottom up attribute you are somebody who makes the blood flow
or you are more well a descending attribute
a little more quiet reserved conservative
the bottom up attributes are as being playful to be cool like prince contemporary adventurous bold or bold as <unk> fast or <unk> extreme <unk> or mystic as <unk>
or you are a rather than descending attribute
you are conscious they are sophisticated as <unk>
you are able to be a traditional protector provider you are having oprah
you are trustworthy they are stable familiar with safe or contemplative or elegant or wise as the dalai lama or <unk>
in the course of this film we had more than 500 and descending companies they said no they did not want to form part of this project
they did not want to have anything to do with this film mostly because they would not have control they would not have control over the end product
we allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie how now they use mri to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as to movie
we went to san paulo where they have banned advertising to open air
in the entire city over the last five years there is no fences there is no posters there is nothing
and we went to school districts where companies are getting their way into schools with liquidity problems in america
the amazing thing to me is that the projects that i have had the biggest answer or that i have been more successful in the ones that i have interacted with things directly
and that is what these brands did
the <unk> took to their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies do not have my best interest in mind
i am going to try directly with the artist
i am going to work with him to create something different something that is going to be thinking about people who are going to challenge the way we look at the world
and how did they have been successful
well since the film was first in the nearing let us take a look
so according to <unk> the film was first in january and since then and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million impressions in the media for this film
this is just a period of two weeks and a half weeks
that is just online nor press tv
the film is still not <unk>
it is still not online it is not in <unk>
it has not even presented in other countries yet
ultimately this film has already begun to win momentum
and it is not wrong because it is almost all the agencies that we talked to you about their clients will not be part
i have always believed that if you risk if you are taking risks that in those risks there are opportunities
i think when you pull people out of that you are pushing them up
i think when you train their employees at risk aversion is preparing all of their company to get it out of rewards
i feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to take chances
we have to encourage people to do not fear of the opportunities that they can do it
ultimately we are going to move forward i think we have to give to fear
we have to put that bear in a cage
<unk> fear <unk> risk
at one time we have to embrace the risk
and ultimately we have to harbor transparency
today more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way
and that said this with honesty and transparency all my talk <unk> transparency has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by whom bought the rights of the name on ebay
it is turning big data into great opportunities for companies around the world
<unk> presents the transparency
thank you very much
june cohen then morgan at the name of transparency that happened exactly with those trials
more it is a remarkable question
in my pocket i have a check for the name of the ted type organization the <unk> foundation a check for it to be applied to my care for ted next year
the idea behind the smart computer worm is actually very simple
we do not want iran to get the nuclear bomb
their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> of uranium in <unk>
the gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time systems
if we managed to compromise these systems that control and valves we can because a lot of problems with the centrifuge
the gray boxes do not use windows on windows are a completely different technology
but if we managed to put an effective virus on windows on a laptop that is used by an engineer to set up this gray box then we are ready
this is the plan behind stuxnet
we started with a <unk> windows
the <unk> enters the gray box damage the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission accomplished
it is easy huh
i want to tell you how we discovered this
when we started looking at stuxnet six months ago the purpose was completely unknown
the only thing you knew is that it is very very complex on the part of windows the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities at zero
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes these systems of control
that is called the attention and we started an experiment in which we infect our surroundings with stuxnet and we saw what was going on with this
so they were very strange things
stuxnet behaves like a laboratory rat that he did not like our cheese the wave but i did not want to eat
it had no sense for me
and after experimenting with different flavors of cheese i realized and i thought this is an attack run
it is completely run
the <unk> is actively seeking in the grey box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working in that place
if not stuxnet does not do anything
so that i called my attention and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day because i thought we do not know what the goal is
it might be say for example a you.s energy plant or a chemical plant in germany
better than <unk> the goal soon
so we pulled out and <unk> the attack code and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs a small one
we also saw that they were armed with very professionally by people who obviously had the entire internal information
they knew all the points that i attack
you probably even know how much matches the operator
so you know everything
and if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high tech let me tell you the payload is very complex
it is very above everything we have seen before
here you see a sample of this attack code
we are talking about 15 thousand lines of code
it looks pretty old language that looks like it
i want to tell you how we could find sense of this code
what we were looking for at the beginning were calls to the functions of the system because we know what they do
then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage them with the real world with potential real world targets
we need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
to get to theories about goals we remember it is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable target and it is probably located in iran because it is where most of the infections have been <unk>
you do not find several thousand targets in that area
it basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> plant
so i said to my assistant <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants among our clients
i called them and i asked them in an effort to marry their experience with what we found in code and data
and it worked pretty well
so we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of rotor
rotor is that mobile part inside the centrifuge that black object you see
if you run the speed of this rotor certainly you can get it out and even make the centrifuge
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to return to the maintenance engineers so that they could not solve this quickly
we try to decipher the big digital <unk> looking very closely looking at the data and its structures
so for example the number is <unk> out of that code you can not afford it
i started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are structured in what it is called a waterfall and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
that made sense there was a coincidence
and he got better yet
these <unk> in iran are split in 15 parts called stages
and guess what we found in the attack code
a almost identical structure
so again that was a good coincidence
this gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands
so no misunderstanding was not that
the results have been taken out after several weeks of hard work
they normally have <unk> on dead ends and we had to go back
and yet we found that both digital warheads were meant to only one and the same thing but from different angles
the small <unk> is taking a waterfall and making these rotors and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six glass and manipulating valves
in sum we are very confident that we have determined what is the recipient
it is <unk> and it is just <unk>
we should not worry that other goals are <unk> for stuxnet
here i am showing you some very interesting things that we saw really impressed me
there is the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
what this thing does is <unk> the input values of sensors for example of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides legitimate code which still run during the attack with false input data
and believe it or not these false input data is <unk> by stuxnet
it is kind of like in hollywood movies where during the theft of security the security camera is fed video
it is great huh
the idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control
it is really much more dangerous and aggressive
the idea is <unk> a digital security system
we need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast
for example in a energy plant when the big steam turbine is going on the speed you have got to open loads of escape on a millisecond
obviously this can not do it a human operator
that is where we need digital security systems
and when they are engaged then they can spend bad things
the plant can exploit
and the <unk> and the security system will notice you
that scares me
but it may be worse
what i am going to say is very important
think about this this attack is generic
it has nothing to do specifically with <unk> with uranium
it could also work for example in a energy plant or a automotive factory
it is generic
and you do not have as an attacker that disseminate this burden on a usb key as we saw in the stuxnet case
you could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
let us make it possible
and if you made that with what <unk> is with a <unk> weapon of mass destruction
that is the consequence we need to deal with
unfortunately the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east
it is in the united states and japan
all the green areas are spaces with large number of goals
we must face the consequences and better than let us start making now
thank you
chris anderson i have a question
ralph has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this
what is your opinion
ralph <unk> okay they really want to hear this
yeah okay
my view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not israel
the engine behind this is the cyber superpower
there is one and that is the united states fortunately fortunately
because otherwise our problems would be even larger
ca thank you for <unk> thank you ralph
i want you to imagine a robot that you can take and i am going to take a little bit of skills or another one that makes some chairs in the wheels raise them and go back
in <unk> <unk> we call these exoskeletons
they are not anything different than something you put in the morning gives you a big force that also increases your speed and help for example to handle the balance
it is actually the true integration of man and the machine
but not only that can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other foreign conditions
this is not an unreal idea
so to show you now what we are working on we started talking about the american soldier who on average has to carry on their back a 45 pound load and it is being held up to get even more equipment
obviously this leads to some major complications in the back in the 30 of the soldiers with chronic damage
so we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue
let me introduce you to the <unk> or make universal human loads
soldier with the exoskeleton <unk> i can carry 90 kilos of variables on the ground for many hours
their flexible design allows you to put out of water crawling and running movements with large agility
it perceives what i want to do or where i want to go and then it increases my strength and my resistance
<unk> <unk> we are ready with our industrial partner to produce this device this new exoskeleton this year
it is a reality
let us go back to the users of chairs and i feel particularly passionate about what i am particularly passionate about
there are 68 million people who are about in lawn chairs around the world
as one percent of the population
and this is a really conservative calculation
we talk about something that happens often very young people with damage on the spinal cord than when they start their life at the 20 30 or 40 years collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option
we are also talking about the population that is older rapidly as quickly
their only option many times a brain injury or some other complication is the wheelchair
and this has been like this for the last 500 years since his successful emergence as i must recognize
so we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility
let me introduce you to the <unk> that is using amanda <unk> who ago 19 years ago had an injury in the spinal cord and as a result he could not go back for 19 years until now
amanda <unk> thank you
eb amanda is using our <unk> that i mentioned
it has some sensors
it is completely non invasive on crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back
there is a few batteries that give the engines to the engines in the hips and on the knees and they do it forward with this soft and very natural gait
i was 24 years old at the top of my life when a stranger jump in the air skiing down it was paralyzed
in a fraction of a second i lost all feeling and all the motion of the pelvis down
shortly after a doctor i went to my room in the hospital and said to me amanda never will come back
that happened 19 years ago
so i stole to the last little bit of hope of my own
the technology of adaptation since then has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride in hand bicycle
but they have not invented anything that allowed me to walk
thank you
eb as you can see we have the technology we have got the platforms to sit and talk to you
it is in our hands and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations not just soldiers but to amanda and all the phone users to all
ab thank you
i just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival
it is a place where women have the baton they practice sex to say hello and play is the order of the day where the fun is something
and no it is not the hot man festival or san francisco
ladies and gentlemen you know their cousins
this is the world of the wild bonobos of rainforests
the bonobos are along with chimpanzees their closest relatives
that means we all share a common ancestry an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago
now chimpanzees are known for their aggression
but unfortunately we have done too focused on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution
but the bonobos show us the other side of the coin
whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big terrifying types the society bonobo is in charge of females with power
these guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not been observed
but unfortunately the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes
they live in the depths of the rainforest and it has been very difficult to study them
the congo is a paradox an extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of the <unk> same stage of a violent conflict that has been extended for decades and caused almost so many deaths as the first world war
no wonder that this destruction will also put in danger to the bonobo survival
the trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes you can not fill and a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world and honestly we are not sure that
yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden the trees
who are these cousins
we know them as the apes make love not the war because they have frequent sex <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems
i am not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the bonobo of the bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
the bonobos like humans love to play throughout their lifetime
playing is not just a child game
for us and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage tolerance
with him we learn to trust and we learn the rules of the game
play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of diversity of diversity diversity of behaviors of connections
and when you look at the game bonobo you see the evolutionary roots the real evolutionary roots the dance and the human ritual
play is the glue that unites us
i do not know how you play it but i want to show you a couple only only taken from the wild
first it is a kind of a female style game and i do not talk about football
here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase
look at what she is doing
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase he has caught on the balls
just i think in this case he loves it right
yeah
so sexual play is common so much in bonobos as humans
and this video is really interesting because it shows this video it is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in the game like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> trust and at the same time it is more fun
but the game is <unk>
the game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways some of which are more imaginative imaginative imaginative perhaps the place where the wonder is
and i want you to see this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with water that is just playing with water
i think as she sometimes played alone and explore the limits of our inner and outside worlds
and it is that playful curiosity that drives us to explore and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity
these are just small samples of understanding that bonobos are given us from our past and present
but they also have a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation
the secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities
in other words play is our <unk> <unk>
to adapt to a world that changes we have to play
but let us take it into the most of our game capacity
play is not frivolous
the game is essential
for bonobos and humans equally life is not just cruel and ruthless
when it seems at least appropriate play can be the moments that it is the most urgent
and so fellow primates let us accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity friendship and wonder
thank you
in new york i am responsible for a nonprofit organization called robin hood
when i am not fighting poverty <unk> fires as a captain of captain on a body of volunteer fire
and in our city where the volunteers to become highly skilled staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action
i remember my first fire
i was the second volunteer on the site so i had a pretty high probability of going
but yet there was a race up against the other volunteers to get to the captain and find out what our task was
when i found the captain he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life
we were at a full night she was standing outside the rain under an umbrella in barefoot pajamas while his house was on flames
the other volunteer that i had just got before i was going to get rid of the first one the first one came first to the captain first and he asked him to go into and save the dog owner
the dog i was so jealous
there was a lawyer or <unk> of money for the rest of his life i would have to tell people that i entered a burning building to save a live alive just because i won for five seconds
well i was the next
the captain made me a <unk>
he said bezos i need that between the house
i need you to go up <unk> the fire and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes
i swear
it was not exactly what i was hoping but i went up the stairs at the end of the hallway i went to the actual firemen that at the top or less they had finished fire and walked into the main fourth looking for a pair of shoes
i know what you are thinking but i am not a hero
i took my load back the staircase where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door
we got out of the house the treasures for the house owner where it was from waiting her treasure received a lot more attention than mine
a few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owner by the brave working effort to save their house
the kindness that she watched over the other was someone had reached him even a pair of shoes
so much in my calling in robin hood as in my calling as a volunteer fireman i am a witness of acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale but also of grace and courage to the individual level
and you know what i have learned
it all has its importance
so when i look at this room to people who have achieved or have remarkable levels of success i would like to remind you this not wait
do not wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life
if you have got something to give <unk> now
you have got food in a dining room a park in the neighborhood
be mentors
not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save someone's life but every day we will be able to influence someone's life
so you get into play run through the shoes
thank you
bruno giussani mark mark comes back
mark bezos thank you
this may seem strange but i am a big fan of the concrete block
the first concrete blocks are built in 1868 with a very simple idea modules of concrete as they fit together
very quickly these became the most used construction unit in the world
they have allowed us to build bigger things than we like buildings or bridges a brick at the time
essentially these blocks have become the pillars of our time
almost a hundred years later in 1947 lego came up with this
he was called machine assembly brick
and in a few years the lego bricks came to every home
it is estimated that they have been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet
you do not have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses
lego made it accessible
lego just adopted the concrete block in the world and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination
meanwhile the exact same year in the bell labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks piled upon each other to a world where everything was interactive
like the concrete block the transistor allows to create much larger and more complex circuits a brick at the time
but there is a main difference the transistor was just for experts
i personally do not know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts so i decided to change it
eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers
a few years ago i started developing <unk>
let me show you how they work
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function
they are <unk> to be light sound engines and sensors
and the best thing about it is that they come together by magnets together
so you can not put it wrong
the bricks have a code code
the green is the way the blue is the pink the pink is the entrance and the orange is the wire
so you just put together a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make larger circuits
one blue with one green makes light
we can put a button in the middle and so we have a regulator regulator
if we change the button by a pulse module that is here and now we have a light on it
we added this doorbell to create more impact and we have a noise machine
i am going to stop this
so beyond simple play <unk> are actually very powerful
instead of having to program connect and screw up <unk> it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures
to make it faster or slower just just tour this button that makes your pulse faster or slower
the idea behind <unk> is that it is a growing collection
we want all the interactions in the world you are reduced to bricks ready to use
lights sounds solar cells everything must be accessible
we have given the kids to see them playing with them
and it is been an incredible experience
the best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you do not learn in schools
for example how a light is working or why the door of an elevator is kept open or how an ipod responds to touch
we have also led to design schools
so for example designers without experience some in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material
here you can see with bottles of paper and felt we have got <unk> creating
metal sound a few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers of design school from rhode island who do not have any experience in engineering just in cardboard and paper and we told them do something
here's an example of a project that have made a slow activated cannon activated
but wait here is my favorite project
it is a locust that is made of play dough that is afraid of darkness
for these non engineers <unk> became another material electronics became another material
and we want this material to reach for everyone
so it is like it is open source
you can visit the website download all of the design files and make sure
we want to encourage a world of creators inventors and collaborators because this world that we live in this interactive world is ours
so go ahead and invent
thank you
i am going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries
i work in the solar technology industry
and my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focus on
distributed collaboration
this is a little video of what we do
uh wait a moment
you can take a little bit of charge
we can be able to continue better we leave the video on one side
no
this is not
all right
solar technology is
oh i have been a term time
okay thank you very much
a couple of years ago i launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical designers to take a year and work in a environment that represent almost everything that is supposed to be involved in the government
the initiative was called code for america and it would be like peace bodies for instance
we select some members every year and we put them to work with municipalities
instead of sending them to the third world we send them into the wild world city
they made great applications worked with the municipal employees
his task is to show the chances of technology today
meet me
it is a fire hydrant in boston city
here it is like if i would look for a quote but what is really looking for is someone to clean it when you are caught by the snow because he knows it is not very good at putting fires when it is covered by a meter of snow
how did they get to ask help in this particular way
last year in boston we had a team of members for america
they were there in february and at that time it is a lot about last year
they realized that the city never wiped out these fire hydrants
but one of the members called erik <unk> <unk> i noticed something more than the legal citizens with shovels sidewalks right in front of them
so he did like any good programmer i developed an app
it is a nice application in which you can take a fire hydrant
you accept clean when it snows
when you do that you put a name in this case he put it into this case
if you do not do it somebody can be able to do it
it is got a playful component
it is a modest app
maybe it is the smallest of the 21 applications that is happening last year
but it does something that no other technology of the government do it
and it extends viral
one responsible system of the city of honolulu to see this app realized that he could use it not for snow but for citizens to take sirens from tsunami
it is very important that they work these examples of tsunami but people are serving the batteries
so it tells citizens to control control
and then seattle decided to use it to make the citizens who are going to be relieved
and chicago just throw it out to make people sit in to clean up sidewalks when it snows
so now we know nine cities that plan to use it
and this has spread out without fixing organic and natural
if you know a little bit of government technology you know that this does not usually happen
the acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years
last year in boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months
it was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children
and then they told us that i have done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two and two million dollars
and that is nothing
now there is a project in the power of california that all the way up to the time there is 2,000 million dollars and it does not work
and there are projects like this in every level of government
so an application that shows in a couple of days and it spreads viral shaped it is a kind of warning to the institution of the government
it suggests to the government better ways to work not like in private companies like a lot of people think it should be
either as a technological company but rather like the internet itself
i mean without restrictions in open and generative form
and that is important
but the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new generation not as a problem of an institution of an institution but as a collective action problem
and that is very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology
and there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy
and it is not just code for america but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities
you have not given up with the government
they feel a great frustration to that but they do not complain about it
and these people know something we have lost from sight
and it is that if we leave the feelings about the policy the row in the <unk> record <unk> and all those other things that they put us nuts the government is essentially in the words of tim <unk> what we do together because alone we can not
now many people have abandoned the government
if you are one of those people i would ask you to do it because things are changing
politics does not change the government yeah
and because the government ultimately grows from us remember that from us the people the way to think about it is going to affect the way to produce change
i did not know a lot of government when i started with this
and as a lot of people i thought the government was to choose people to take charges
well after two years i have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
this is the phone care center of services and information
it is the place that serves the calls if you mark me in the you.s
scott answered this call
i joined the official knowledge base
i found nothing done with animal control
and finally he said hey you can open the doors of the house put music right loud and see if you go
and it worked so well by scott
but that was not the end of the <unk>
boston does not have a call center
it has a web and mobile application called <unk> <unk>
we do not make that application
it was the work of very smart people in the new urban county in boston
one day this happened actually comes this order to hold up in my garbage cube i do not know if it is dead
how do i make it out
<unk> <unk> is different
scott was talking in person
in <unk> <unk> everything is public so everybody can see this
in this case he saw it a neighbor
the next report said i went to the place i found the garbage cube behind the house
<unk> yeah i lived yeah
i turned the cube i went home
good nights sweet <unk>
pretty simple
this is great it is the confluence of the digital and the physical
and it is also a great example of the income of government to collaboration voluntary collaboration
but it is also a great example of government as a platform
and here i do not necessarily mean the definition of technological platform
i am talking about a platform for people to engage and help others
so one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role
connected to the two people
and it might have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper choice than the government services
when a neighbor helps another <unk> the communities
if we call animal control that costs a lot of money
one important thing that we need to think about the government is that it is not the same as politics
a lot of people understand it but you think you are the input of the other
our input to the government system is the vote
how many times have you chosen a political leader sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government reflects our values and they would perceive our needs but then we do not see changes
that is because the government is like an immense ocean and the policy is the superficial layer of 15 inches
underneath it is what we call bureaucracy
and we say that word with a lot of contempt
but it is that contempt what keeps us that is that we finance as something that is operating in our against that other thing and as a result we are losing power
people believe that politics is sexy
if we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy for sexy
because it is where the real work is happening
we have to collaborate with the machinery of government
that is the <unk> movement
you have seen them
it is a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the internet commission commission on the financial reform project
that is not political activism is activism activism
and for those of us that we have resigned in front of the government is time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave with your children
you have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face
they really believe that we are going to get where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all
we can not do it on government we need it to be more effective
the good news is that with technology is possible to <unk> the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society
there is a generation that grew up with the internet and he knows it is not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way
the average age of our members is 28 years old so i am so often a greater generation than many of them
this is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted
they are not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about everybody will talk
you can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it
so when you face the government problem they do not care so much to do to hear their voices
they are using hands
they put hands on the work to program applications that make better work better
and those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities
it can be cleaning up a hydrant pulling out weeds dumping a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside
we were always able to be cleaned up those fire fire and a lot of people do it
but these applications are as digital reminders that we are not only consumers are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services
we are more than that we are citizens
and we are not going to fix the government until they do not have citizenship
so i want to ask everybody here when it comes to the important things we have to do together all together we will be a crowd of voices or we will also be a crowd of hands
thank you
this is for me a real honor
i have spent most of the time in prisons prisons and in the death row
i have spent most of my life in marginalized communities to projects and places where there is a lot of despair
and i will be here at ted watching and hearing these stimulation have given me a lot of energy
one of the things i have noticed in this short time is that ted has identity
and the things that they say here is impact around the world
sometimes if something comes from ted it makes sense and a force that would not have otherwise
i mean this because i think identity is <unk> important
here we have seen fantastic presentations
and i think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense but if you are taught with feeling they can have a special meaning
a doctor can do good things <unk> if it is <unk> it can achieve much more
so i want to talk about the power of identity
i did not really learn this in the practice of the right my job
i learned from my grandmother
i grew up in a traditional african american family dominated by a matriarch that was my grandmother
it was hard it was strong it was power
it was the last word in all discussion in the family
she occupied many of them in our home
it was a daughter of people who had been slaves
their parents were born in slavery in virginia and 1840
she was born on the 1880 and his experience with slavery with slavery as i saw the world
she was hard but it was also loving
when i was a little girl and i looked at it she was approaching me and gave me a good hug
i was so strong i could barely breathe and then i would leave it
one or two hours later i would go back and look at it i would come up and say <unk> you still feel my hug
and if i told him he did not take me again and if he said i would leave him in peace
i had this human quality i would always want to be close to it
the only problem is i had 10 children
my mother was the lower 10
sometimes when i was going to spend a while with it it was not easy to catch his time and his attention
my cousins were running everywhere
i remember when i was eight nine years old i woke up one morning i went to the room and there were running all my cousins
my grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me
i thought i was a game
and then he looked at it and she smiles but she was very serious
after 15 20 minutes she stood up i went through the room and he said you see <unk> two we are going to talk about them
i remember this as if it was yesterday
i will never forget
it took me outside and he said let me tell you something but you can not tell anybody
i said okay breast
she said now i am not going to do it i said of course
and then i sat down i looked at me and said i want you to know i have been watching
and he said i think you are special
he said i think you can do whatever you want
i will never forget
and then he told me i just want you to give me three <unk> things
i said safe breast
and he said the first thing i want you to do is they always want your mother
he said she is my <unk> and you have got to get <unk> that always <unk>
like i loved my mom i said yes breast so i will
and then he told me the second thing i want you to do is you are always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is hard
i thought it and i said yes breast so i will
and then finally he said the third thing i want you to come up is that you would never miss alcohol
i was nine years old and i said yes breast so i will
i grew up in the field in south rural i have a brother a year older and a sister a year younger
when i was 14 15 one day my brother came home with a six team package i do not know where he pulled them out i grabbed my sister and me and we went to the forest
we are just doing the crazy things forever
he took a sip of beer he offered my sister she took a little and she was offered me
i said no no no it is okay you follow but i am not going to take beer
my brother said come on today and you are always doing the same thing that we do
i took something your sister also take a beer
i said no i would not feel good you can follow
and then my brother looked at me
and he said what happens to you take a beer
i went up with a force and i went on there not to be you are thinking about the conversation with breast
i said but what are you talking about
he said breast says all the grandchildren that are special
i got rid of it
i have to admit something to you
i will tell you something i should probably not say
i know this is spreading widely
but i am 52 years old and i can admit i have never taken a drop of alcohol
i do not say this thinking it is a virtue i say it by the power that has identity
when we created the right type of identity we say things to the other who really do not make sense
we can not get to do things that you do not think we can do
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all your grandchildren were special
my grandfather had been a prisoner during the ban
my uncles died of disease related disease
and these were the things that we had to engage with
now i will try to talk about our criminal justice system
this country is very different from what was 40 years ago
in 1972 there were 300,000 prisoners
today there is 2.3 million
in the united states we have the highest incarceration rate in the world
we have seven million people in probation
and this massive incarceration in my view has changed fundamentally our world
in poor communities or black and you find that much <unk> so much <unk> by these facts
one of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or probation
in urban <unk> across the country the los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington washington 50 to 60 percent of all the color color are in jail or probation
our system is not just distorted in front of race it is also about poverty
in this country we have a justice system that makes you much better if you are rich and guilty that if you are poor and innocent
it is not guilt it is wealth but wealth affects the results
and it seems to be very quiet
the fear of fear and anger makes us believe these are not problems
we are disconnected
it seems interesting to me
we are looking at our work some very curious developments
in my state in alabama as well as in other states you are going to come from rights forever if you have a criminal conviction
right now in alabama the 34 percent of the black population has been lost definitely the right to the vote
and if we projected it to the next 10 years the loss of loss of rights will be as high as he passed the law of the right to vote
we have this amazing silence
i represent kids
many of my clients are very young
the united states is the only country in the world where it is sentence in 13 years to die in prison
we have in this country prison for children without chance to come out
right now we are in a process of some litigation
the only country in the world
i represent people in death row
this issue of death penalty is interesting
in some sense we have been able to think that the final question is people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
a very sensitive question
but you can think of another way about how we are in our identity
there is another way to look at it it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the crime crimes but if we deserve to kill
this is interesting
death penalty death is defined by error
in every nine people executed have identified one which is innocent which is <unk> and released from death row
an amazing mistake an innocent one of every nine
this is interesting
aviation is not allowed to fly planes if in every nine that you would take off you would have got off
but somehow we get away from the problem
it is not our problem
it is not our charge
it is not our struggle
i talk a lot about these things
i talk about race and this is what we deserve to kill
it is interesting that in my classes with students in african american history i talk about slavery
i talk to you about terrorism the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted until world war ii
we do not really know a lot about this
but for black americans in this country it was a bit defined by terror
in many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
they worried about being bombarded
the threat of terror was what defined their lives
now there are major people who come to me and say mr stevenson you teach talks to talk to people who stop saying that in our history deal with terrorism after the <unk>
they ask me to say no no say that we grew up with that
the age of terrorism went on obviously with segregation and decades of mortality and separation
in this country we have a dynamic that we do not like to talk about our problems
we do not like to talk about our story
and that is why we have not understood the meaning of what historically we have done
all the time we have <unk> each other
we constantly create tensions and conflicts
it costs us to talk about races i think it is because we are not willing to engage with a real and reconciliation process
in south africa people understood that they could not overcome the racial segregated without a compromise with truth and reconciliation
in rwanda even before genocide had this commitment but in this country we have not done it
i was in germany giving conferences about death penalty
it was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said you know that it is good worrying listening to what you say
he said we do not have a death penalty in germany
naturally we will never be able to do it here
the room was stuck in silence and a lady said there is no way that with our story we can never get into the systematic death of human beings
it would be irrational that we intentional and deliberately we would put people to run
i thought about this
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany would take especially if they were in their most jews
we could not tolerate it
it would be irrational
and yet there is this disconnect
i think our identity is in danger
if we actually do not care about these things so difficult the positive and wonderful things are yet involved
we love innovation
we are fascinated by technology we worship creativity
we love entertainment
but lately these realities are <unk> by suffering and abuse the degradation
in my view it is necessary to integrate both
lately we talk about the need to have more hope more commitment to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world
i think that means spend more time thinking and talking about the poor the ones that will never come to ted
thinking about them it is sort of something that is within us
it is true that we have to believe in issues we have not seen
so we are despite being so rational so committed to intellectual
with innovation with creativity development comes not just about brain ideas
these things come from ideas of ideas as well by convictions
this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just and brilliant and dazzling but also in the dark and hard
fourteen <unk> the great czech leader spoke about this
he said when we were in eastern europe suffering from oppression we wanted all sorts of things but mostly what we needed was hope for the spirit a will for being in some places of despair and witness
well that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what i think even in communities like ted has to engage
there is no disconnect that is related to technology and design that allows us to be truly human if we do not pay attention to poverty by exclusion to injustice
now i want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things
we go back to them
i had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet rosa parks
these women were together just to talk
occasionally mrs <unk> called me to say <unk> comes from mrs parks we are going to get together to speak
do you want to come and listen
i would say yes madam i want
so she said well and what are you going to do when you come
i said listen to them
so i went and i would just heard it
it was something very <unk> very <unk>
and on one occasion i was there listening to these ladies and after a couple of hours mrs parks went to me and said now let me tell you that it is that idea of justice equal
tell me what you are trying to do
and i started giving my speech
i said well we are trying to challenge injustice
we try to help those who have been convicted unfairly
we are trying to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice
we are trying to end up with the lifetime of life without probation
we are trying to do something about death penalty
we are trying to reduce the population in jails
we are trying to end up with mass <unk>
i d all my best speech and i would end up and said hmm hmm hmm hmm
and he said you will end up exhausted very exhausted
at that time mrs <unk> leaned over the face and said that is why you have to be very brave but very brave
i think actually the ted community has to be much more <unk>
we need to find the way to deal with those challenges that problems that is suffering
because finally humanity depends on compassion for others
i have learned some very simple things in my work
i have been educated in simple things
i have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have done
i think that is true for everybody on the planet
i am convinced that if someone says a lie it is not because it is a liar
i am sure if someone takes something that does not belong to me it is not that it is a thief
even if someone kills another not it is a killer
and so i think there is a basic dignity in the people who have to be respected by the law
i also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world the opposite of poverty is not wealth
so it is not
i really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice
and finally i think although it is very dramatic very very beautiful very inspiring very inspiring we do not judge by our technology for our designs or our intellectual or rational capacity
in the end they judge the character of a society not because they treat the rich powerful and privileged but by the way they treat the poor people who were convicted of prisoners
because it is in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are
sometimes i feel <unk> i will end with a story
sometimes i do too much force
you get tired like everybody
sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories in a major way
i have been representing these kids who have been convicted of <unk>
i am going to jail and i see my clients at 13 and 14 years old they have been <unk> so they were being told as adults
and i start thinking about how it can be
how can one judge turn someone into what is not
the judge is <unk> as an adult but i see a child
one night i was awake thinking about god if the judge can become something you are not having to have magical powers
yes <unk> the judge has magical powers
you should ask for something about that
as i was very late i could not think correctly but i started working on a <unk>
i had a 14-year old customer a little black black
i started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said <unk> so that my black customer was 14 i was treated as a 75 year old privilege of a corporation
in the <unk> i put it out there had been conduct acknowledged in the accusation in the behavior of the police and in the process
there was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics
the next morning i woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or i wrote it
for my horror i was not just <unk> but i had sent it to the court
two months spent about two months i had forgotten it
and finally i decided oh god i have to go to court by this case stupid
i got in the car and i felt really overwhelmed overwhelmed
i went on the car to court
i thought this would be very very difficult and pitiful
i finally got down the car i walked to court
i was going up the stairs when i found myself with a black black man he was the superintendent of court
when he saw me he came up to me and said who is you
i said i am a lawyer he said he is you lawyer i said yes
so i came up and get away
and i whispered in the ear
he said i am proud of you
i have to tell you now that that was <unk>
that got deeply connected with me with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope
well i went into the audiences room
when i get into the judge he saw me
and he said mr stevenson you wrote this bold <unk>
i said yes mr i went and we started to argue
people started getting everybody <unk>
i was the one that had written those crazy things
the cops came to the policemen the geneticists who come the dots
suddenly not knowing how the room was full of people all furious because we were talking about races because we were talking about poverty because we were talking about inequality
with the <unk> of the eye i had to see when i was going and came
and i would look out the window and i would try to hear everything that <unk>
i kept walking over here and there
finally this old black man with the face of concern i walked into the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers
about 10 minutes later the judge decreed a break
during the break a sheriff's assistant has been shown because he had entered the room
the <unk> <unk> over the old black
and jimmy said what do you do in the audiences room
and the old black man stood up i looked at me and he looked at me and he said i went to this audience room to tell this young man to keep his view in the objective
i have come to ted because i think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large but it folds into justice
we can not be truly human <unk> if we do not care about human rights and by dignity
that our survival is connected to others
our visions of technology design entertainment and creativity you need to touch the brotherhood compassion and justice
and above all of all those of you in the room who share this i just want to tell you that keep your sight in the objective
thank you very much
chris anderson you just heard and see an obvious desire for the audience of this community to help in your purposes of doing something
something that is not a check what can we do
bs there are several opportunities close
if you live in the state of california for example there will be a <unk> this spring which is going to be an effort for <unk> the funds that are spent today in punishment
for example here in california are going to spend a billion dollars worth of death in the next five years billion dollars
and despite this 46 percent of <unk> cases did not <unk> in arrests
the 56 percent of rape is not at all
here's a chance of change
this <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law to security
i think there is a very close opportunity
ca there is been a huge decline in crime in the united states in the last three decades
part of the explanation is that it has to do with the highest incarceration rate
what would you say to you that you think it is like this
bs actually the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable
the big growth in mass incarceration in this country is not by crimes with violence
it is the wrong war against drugs
that is why this dramatic increase in the prison population
and we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of punishment
we have got three legal causes to take people to life of life by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against property instead of making those resources to their victims
i think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less
it seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does not do anything for anybody
i think that is the orientation that has to change
ca <unk> have you really excited about here today
you are very inspiring
thank you very much for having come to ted thank you

oh my god
peter diamandis these are just some of the clips that i got done in the last six months being able to be in the last six days or the last six years
the idea is that the press media would prefer to <unk> negative news because our minds are paid attention
and that responds to a very good reason
in every second of every day our senses are getting many more data than the brain probably can process
and like nothing we care more to survive the first stop of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala
the amygdala is our early warning detector the danger detector
it orders and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm
so from a <unk> of stories we are going to look at the negative
that old saying of the press if there is blood sells it is very true
and because all digital devices give us negative news seven days of the week 24 hours a day no wonder that we are pessimistic
it is not surprising that people think the world is going wrong
but maybe it is not
maybe instead what really happens is we get <unk>
maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces it is accelerating so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades
i am not saying that we do not have our good problems climate change the extinction of species water scarcity and energy no doubt we have
as human beings we are very good at solving the problems and the long we have done with them
let us look at it in the last century to see where we are going
over the last hundred years the average of life has been more than doubled per capita income per capita is tripled around the world
child mortality has reduced 10 times
also the cost of food for transportation food and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times
steve pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history
and charles miko that the world literacy went from 25 percent in the last 130 years
we are really living an extraordinary time
a lot of people forget it
and we keep giving up expectations and higher expectations
in fact we redefined the meaning of poverty
think about it today in the united states a lot of people who live under the poverty line have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile air air conditioning and cars
<unk> <unk> of the last century <unk> <unk> on the planet would have never dreamed of such luxury
supporting a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve moore's law and double performance performance in about 12 to 24 months
that is why the mobile phone in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 70s
now look at this curve
it is moore's law for the last hundred years
i want you to watch two things on this curve
first the soft thing that is in good and bad times in the war and in the peace in the recession in depression and in the rise
it is the very very rapid computers that is used to build faster computers
it does not stop before none of the big challenges
and although it is <unk> in a law on the left it is going up it goes up
the growth rate of technology is getting faster
and in this curve to moore's law there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today
the computation in the cloud that my friends from autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics 3d printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production throughout the planet the synthetic biology of fuels vaccines vaccines vaccines and the digital medicine the digital medicine the digital medicine
i say how many saw the victory on jeopardy from ibm
it was a spade
i looked at the newspapers the best headline
and i loved this watson <unk> human opponents
jeopardy is not an easy game
it plays the nuances of human language
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud available for everyone on the mobile phone
four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i launched a new university called <unk> university
we teach these technologies to our students and in particular how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity
and every year we asked them to release a company or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade
think about that the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people
thirty years ago that would have <unk> <unk>
today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done
when i think about creating abundance it does not mean to create fancy life for each of us on the planet it is about creating a life of possible
it is about taking that which is scarce and making it plentiful
you see scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources
let me give you an example
it is a story about napoleon three of the 1800s
he is the guy on the left
i invited dinner the king of <unk>
chainsaw troops ate with covered of silver and the same napoleon with covered gold
but the <unk> king ate with aluminum covered
you see aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet was worth more than gold and platinum
that is why the tip of the monument to washington is aluminum
you see even though aluminum is the oecd mass of the earth it does not come as a pure metal
it is tied down for oxygen and <unk>
but then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
let us <unk> this analogy to the future
let us think about energy scarcity
ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet bathed for 5,000 times more energy that we use in a year
they get to the earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes
it is not about scarcity but about accessibility
and there is good news
this year for the first time the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the generated of the generated of diesel takes rupees versus 17 rupees
the cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year
last month mit published a study that shows that by the end of the decade in the <unk> parts of the united states solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average
and if we have energy abundance we have plenty of water
let us talk about the wars for water
remember when carl sagan pointed into the voyager spacecraft towards the earth in 1990 after i spent saturn
he pulled out a famous picture
a pale blue dot
because we live on a planet of water
we live on a planet covered in 70 percent water
yes <unk> is water saltwater 2 is ice and we fought for one percent of the water on the planet but also there is a hope
it is a technology available not in 10 20 years but right now
so it comes nanotechnology
in a conversation with dean kamen this morning one of the innovators in the <unk> i would like to share with you with you for you to do this your technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> it is the size of a small refrigerator
it is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any source saltwater salt water a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon
the president of coca cola just thought i will make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world
if that comes out well and i have full confidence where it is going to be coca cola to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet
this is an ongoing innovation for this technology that exists today
and we have seen it in mobile phones
oh my god we are going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013
think about it that maasai warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of kenya that the president reagan 25 years ago
and to tell you with a smartphone with google has access to more knowledge and information that president clinton 15 years ago
it lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted
better than that the things that you and i have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video health images libraries of books and music diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones
maybe the best thing comes when you show the applications in health
last month i had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> foundation something called the x <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars
we are challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device with which they speak and because they have a.i you can imagine you can get blood out of your finger
to win has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team
imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors where water charge is 25 percent and there is 1.3 percent of health workers
now when this device is <unk> a rna virus or dna that does not try to call the world of health and first to prevent the pandemic happening
but this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance
i call it the billion growing up
the white lines here are the population
we just spent the mark of seven billion
by the way the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health
in 2010 we had less than two billion people online connected
by 2020 it will go from two billion to five billion internet users
three billion minds never before the global conversation add up to the global conversation
what will these people want
what would not you want to do
and instead of economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy
and <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with academia academy and because of the use of impressions in 3d and computing in the cloud they will be more productive than ever before
what can we provide three million more members of healthy healthy educated and productive humanity
how about voices never heard before
what if we give them the oppressed wherever you are a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time
what about three billion
and if they are contributions that we can not predict
something i learned with the x prize is that small equipment guided by his passion with a clear goal they can do extraordinary things things that before they could only do the big corporations and governments
i am going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited
there is a program that maybe some of you know
it is called foldit
he came up at the university of washington in seattle
it is a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how they will fold the protein
the folds determine the structure and functionality
it is a very important thing in medical research
and so far it was a hard problem problem
they have played with this college professors among others
then hundreds of thousands of people joined in and started playing
and it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers
ladies and gentlemen what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet
we have the tools with this exponential technology
we have the passion of innovative <unk>
we have the capital of <unk>
and we have got three million new minds that we are going to tell us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do
we have got a few extraordinary decades
thank you
i am going to talk about a very small idea
the <unk> of the starting point
and as the idea can be explained in a minute before i will give you three examples to do time
the first story is about charles darwin one of my heroes
he was here how do you know
you might believe that i was supposed to die but it was not
they actually pick up fish
and he described one of them as very common
it was grouper
it was very caught up to the 1880
now the fish is on the red list of the iucn
but we have heard this story a lot of times about galapagos and other places so that has nothing special
but the case is we still come to the galapagos
we still think they are <unk>
the brochures still say they continue intact
so what happens here
second story also illustrates another concept the shift from the waist
because i was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in west africa
i was there because i grew up in europe and then i wanted to work in africa
i thought i could <unk>
i burned so much with the sun and i was convinced that i was not there
this is my first exhibition to the sun
the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees and as you can see the mangroves
there were <unk> from about 20 inches the tilapia of black beard
and the fishing of this tilapia was very plentiful and it was going on for a good time so it was made over average in ghana
when i went there 27 years later the number of fish had halved
go to five inches
they experienced a genetic pressure
there were still fish
in a way they were still happy
and the fish were still happy to be there
it is nothing to change but everything has changed
my third story is that i was complicit in the introduction of los angeles in southeast asia
in the 1970s well well he started in <unk> europe did a lot of development projects
fishing development means imposing the countries that already had 100,000 fishermen <unk> industrial fishing
and this very ugly boat was called <unk> four
i went to fishing in it and we did studies in southern china from south china and mostly in the sea of java
what we capture was something <unk>
we capture it right now the bottom of the sea
ninety 90 percent of what we capture were sponges other animals that are at the bottom
and most of the fish are tiny little about the remains remains that are fish of coral reef
in short the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was launched
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast
in one year you do a study and then start commercial fishing
the background is going to be a robust coral background in this case to be a <unk>
this is a dead turtle
they did not eat them they ate them because they were dead
once we capture a living
he was still not <unk>
so they wanted to kill her because it was a good food
this mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish
but it is not documented
we turn the world but we do not remember it
adjust the point of starting to the new level without remembering what was there
if you look at this something like this
on the y axis we have good biodiversity number of killer whales the water supply
and that changes over time it changes because people do things with <unk>
every generation to use pictures received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward
the difference is they perceive loss
but they do not perceive the loss that happened before
you can analyze the accumulation of changes
and in the end i keep the <unk> remains
and that is largely we want to do now
we want to keep things that are no longer or they are not
but one should think that this problem is affecting people when societies were able to kill animals without knowing what they have done to about generations later
because obviously an animal that is very abundant before extinct it is quite frequent
you do not lose plentiful animals
you lose animals
even if this is not perceived as a huge loss
over time we focus on big animals and in a sea synonymous with large fish
they become little frequent because we take them
over time there are a few fish but we think that is the starting point
and the question is why do we accept this
well we do not know it was different
in fact a lot of <unk> scientists who were very different
and they will do it because the evidence is presented in a previous way it is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence
for example the anecdote that some of you are present as a captain of the captain and i looked at a lot of fish in this area can not be used or usually do not use the scientists in fishing because it is not a scientist
so we have a situation where people do not know the past while we were living in societies that we do not rely on the sources of the past
there is a huge role in there which can be a protected marine zone
because with marine protected areas we really need to visualize the past
recreating the past that people can not conceive of because the starting point has run and it is extremely low
that is for the people who can see a protected marine zone and they can benefit from the vision that gives you to erase their starting point
and what about people who can not do it because they do not have access like the people in the midwest for example
i think there is the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the void the simulation
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay
a long time ago there were gray whales in chesapeake bay 500 years ago
and you may have noticed that the nuances and <unk> are like an avatar
and if you think about avatar if you think about why people were moved with the movie sometime talking about the story of <unk> why would you take the images
because it raises something that in some sense has been lost
so my recommendation the only one i am going to give is to cameron doing avatar ii underwater
thank you very much
hi i am kevin <unk> the youtube manager and i look at youtube videos in a professional way
it is true
so today we will see why the videos are made viral and what important is that
we all want to be stars celebrities singers comedians when i was younger that seemed very very difficult
but today the web makes any of us or of our actions i come from a part of our global culture
anybody can be done famous on the internet in a <unk>
they go up over 48 hours of video to youtube per minute
and from those only one small percentage gets viral and gets countless views and it makes cultural momentum
how does that happen
three things makers of trends communities of participation and factor
well let us start
<unk> <unk> oh my god my god
oh my god
wow
<unk> <unk>
ka last year <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside the national park in yosemite
in 2010 it was 23 million times
this graph shows the clock in the rise of popularity of last summer
<unk> did not tell you do a viral video
i just wanted to share a double rainbow
that is what you do if it is called yosemite mountain <unk>
i had already published many videos of nature
this video was published in january
so what happened here
it was jimmy kimmel
jimmy kimmel published this tweet that we are looking at the video
the creators of trends like jimmy kimmel are present new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience
rebecca black is friday friday you have got to start on friday everybody wants to get the weekend at the end of a week on friday starting on a friday ka you will not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video i hope
friday of rebecca black is one of the most popular videos of the year
you saw it almost 200 million times this year
this graph shows the frequency of use
just like rainbow double this video seemed to have come out of nowhere
so what happened this day
well it was a friday it is true
and if you ask for those other peaks are also a friday
but what happened this day this particular one
well i took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it
michael j. <unk> of <unk> science theater was one of the first people to make a joke about video on twitter
but what is important is that a person or a group of creators are going to take a point of view and they share it with a larger audience accelerating the process
so this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and do things
and now there are 10,000 <unk> on friday on youtube
just in the first seven days there was a parody for each of the other days
unlike one way of the one century one of the 20th century this community involvement is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> or doing something new with that
<unk> cat is a repetitive animation with a music chord
that is that
this year you saw about 50 million times
and if you think that is weird you know there is a three hour version that you have seen four million times
to the cats you saw this video
and there are cats that you saw other cats see the video
but the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the internet <unk> community
there was <unk>
someone made an old version of the old
and then he became international
suddenly there was a whole community of holistic community that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part of
because today we do not just enjoy we participate
who could have predicted something like this
who could have predicted <unk> rainbow double or rebecca black or <unk> cat
what script might have been written to be written with this situation
in a world where you go up two days of video per minute just just the only one and unexpected can make sure that these things have done it
when a friend told me that i had to look at this great video of a guy who are protest versus riders in new york i admit that i did not really interested in too much
casey <unk> i got a ticket for not circular by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you right through the <unk>
ka thanks to the surprise effect and his humor casey <unk> i managed to see five million people saw and understand their idea
so this approach is worth all the new thing that we do creatively
and all of this leads to a big question
<unk> <unk> what does this mean
<unk>
ka what does this mean
the creators in the creative community of creative communities totally unexpected are features of a new kind of media new culture that we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity
as i said before one of the current celebrities of the justin world started on youtube
do not ask permission to express your ideas
now we are all a little owners of our pop culture
these are not the characteristics of the old media are barely media but it will define the entertainment of the future
thank you
this is not a finished story
it is a puzzle that is still building
let me tell you about some of the pieces
imagine the first piece a man burning the work of a whole life
it is a poet a playwright a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country
imagine while the communists come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain
the words for so much time friends <unk>
it is silent in silence
he died broken in history
he is my grandfather
i never met him
but our lives are much more than our memories
my grandmother never allowed me to forget his story
my task was i am not going to leave that it was in vain and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk> it
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> back to the sea
my mother <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died and a married marriage and two little girls
for her life was destined to get a task out of his family and a new life in australia
it was inconceivable for her that i could not do it
and then from a four year old four year old fiction that challenges a boat to the sea dressed in fishing ship
all adults knew the risks
the greatest fear were the pirates rape and death
like most adults my mother had a little bit of poison with poison
if we could first catch we would take it my sister and then she and my grandmother
my first memories are from that boat the constant rhythm of the engine the bow diving into each wave and the vast vast and empty horizon
i do not remember the pirates that came several times but they were fooled with the courage of men on our boat or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours
but yeah i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of malaysia and the young man who collapsed and died the journey was too much for him and the first apple who tried given for the men of the platform
no apple had the same taste
after three months in a refugee camp in melbourne in melbourne
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together
we set up in <unk> a suburb of the workers whose population is composed of immigrants
unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence i did not know in <unk> there was no sense of the right
the smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world
and the <unk> fragments they traded between the people who had one thing in common they were starting again
my mother worked in farms then on a car assembly line working six days double turn
yet i found time to study english and get a title on you technology technology
we were poor
all of the dollars they were assigned and established an extra mentoring in english and mathematics would not matter what i should be removed which was usually new clothes it was always a second hand
two middle pairs for school one to hide the holes of the other
a school uniform to the ankles because i had to last six years
and there were weird <unk> and <unk> on the eyes <unk> and some <unk> <unk> come home
home where
something in me is <unk>
i was accumulating determination and a voice that said i am going to go down
my mother my sister and i slept in the same bed
my mother was paying every night but we were going to tell us about our day and we were listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house
my mother suffered nightmares all of the boat
and my task was to be wake up until his nightmares started to be able to get it
she opened a computer store then studied to be <unk> and opened another business
and women would come with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and <unk> and boys <unk> trapped between two worlds
they looked for subsidies and sponsors
and they created centers
i lived in parallel worlds
in one it was the classic classical student with what he took from myself
in the other i was able to be able in poor wife tragically <unk> by violence drug abuse and isolation
but many people got aid through the years
and because of that work when i was studying my last year of law i was elected the young australian young year
and i was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other but its edges did not fit
so <unk> anonymously of <unk> was now so refugee and social activist invited invited to talk to sites i had never heard to name and in houses whose existence she would never imagined
i did not know the protocols
i did not know how to use the covered
i did not know how to talk about wine
i did not know how to talk about anything
i wanted to retreat to routines and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did it for almost 20 years she was on the day of each and <unk> three still in the same bed
and i said to my mom i could not do it
it reminded me that i had now the same age she had when we went on the boat
he had not ever been an option
do it and he said do not be what you are not
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the testosterone
and the more frankly i talked more about it to speak
i met people from all the roads of life many of them doing what they loved living in the border of possible
and although i finished my degree i realized i could not stand in a career
there had to be another piece of the puzzle
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be a stranger a newly new arrived at the scene and not just that it is okay but it is something that is going to be grateful maybe a gift of the boat
because it is going to be inside it can easily mean <unk> the horizons can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province
i gave them enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that the world breaks but not the way we fear
possibilities that would not have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously
there was an energy there an relentless optimism a rare mixture of humility and courage
so i followed my intuition
i put together a little group of people who the motto can not be done was a compelling challenge
for a year we did not have a dime
at the end of every day he made a giant soup cooker that we all shared
we worked up to good entry night
most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant and we opened up step
i made the decision to move to the you.s
after one journey
my hunch again
three months later i had moved to the adventure
before i end up let me just tell you about my grandmother
she grew up at a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person that mattered
life has not changed for centuries
his father died shortly after she was born
the mother used to grew up alone
at the age of 17 he became a <unk> of a mandarin whose mother beat her
no support of her husband caused an explosion to the <unk> and take the because she is very much more <unk> caused when i won
it can not be done proved to be wrong
i was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in sydney when she died a thousand miles in melbourne
i looked through the <unk> of the shower and i saw it stop on the other side
i knew i had come to say goodbye
my mother called minutes later
days later we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her casket
we tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it
at night a monk came up and told us that i had to close the coffin
my mother asked us to hold his hand
i asked the monk why his hand is hot and the rest of the body as cold
because you have taken your hand from the morning he said
they have not <unk>
if there is a nerve in our family that runs through women
because we were and how life was formed now we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been frustrated
the defeat would have <unk>
now i want to have my own kids and i ask myself about the boat
who might wish for that
however i fear the privilege of the easy right
i can give you a bow in their lives diving brave in every wave the constant rhythm of the engine the vast horizon that is not guarantee anything
i do not know
but if i could give you to you except i would do
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth row
my story starts in <unk> about two years ago
i was in the desert under the heavens with the sufi singer <unk> ali
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient india the mahabharata
in those days when the indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky
now we do it with airplanes
at that time when i was going to get the great prince indian warrior was thirst to pull out a bow and with a <unk> to the floor he would find water
now we do the same with <unk> and machines
the conclusion that we took out was that the machinery had replaced the magic
and that gives me a lot
every time i felt a little bit more than <unk>
i am going to tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i did not have the camera if i could not afford my friends
it seemed like the technology had to allow me to do not kill her
as a child my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
and this age of 50 years was for me the most magical thing
it became a golden door to a world full of pirated images and <unk> in my imagination
i had the feeling that mobile phones the luxury clocks and cameras prevent them together
let us <unk> our inspiration
so i launched this technology i threw this technology to see how to use it to create magic instead of killing her
illustrate books from age 16
so when i saw the ipad i saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world
you can know how we took the book
where are we
they put the text together with the image the animation and touch sound and touch
storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
but what does that do
i am about to launch an interactive application for ipad
he says it puts your fingers on each light
and so he says this box belongs to i write my name
and so i come back a book in the book
in a number of moments i get a <unk> the ipad knows where i live from the gps that comes to me
my inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities
i have talked a lot of magic
and i do not mean magicians and dragons but at that magic of childhood to those ideas that are coming from children
for some reason fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me
so here we have to change the ipad to release fireflies
and it really light up on your way in what subtraction of the book
another idea i was fascinated by a kid was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
so here every book and every world becomes a <unk> that i drag into this magical device inside the device
and this opens up a map
in every dream book there has always been maps but they have been static maps
this is a map that grows <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book
in certain points of the book it is also revealed
now i am going to go in
another incredibly important aspect to me is to create indian content and contemporary content
these are the <unk>
we have all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were in india know their indian counterparts
these poor <unk> have been trapped in the indra cameras for millennia in a <unk> and wet book
so we are bringing them back in a contemporary child story
in a story that is about present issues like the environmental crisis
and talking about the environmental crisis one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked in attached to their pcs they have not gone to the outside world
but now with mobile technology we can take our children to the natural world with their technology
one of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out and take the camera or the ipad and collect images of different natural objects
as a child i had lots of collections of sticks rocks and rocks and shells
for some reason kids do not do it
so to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter of a shot to a flower and then <unk>
in another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then play
so this way you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the web
a child in london puts a picture of a fox and he says oh today i saw a fox
a boy in india says today i saw a monkey
and it is created this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have gone
within the variants of connection between magic earth and technology there is a lot of possibilities
in the next book we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the ipad and the video on and by augmented reality you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house
at a moment the screen is full of leaves
and you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book
we are going to be a world where the forces of nature were <unk> with technology and magic and technology comes up to one another
we take the energy from the sun
we are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic joy and child love that we sit through a simple story
thank you
i would like to talk to you about why many projects of health fail
and i think really the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients
and one of the things we did at the <unk> university was on a <unk> director
and not in a very scientific way she raised a little cup of coffee or you and i asked family and known what happens
how can we help it
and we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems so everyone or maybe not all of the projects of health and health fail because we stop listening
this is my wi fi scale it is very simple
he has a stick on and off
every morning i get on
and i know i have a challenge as you can see
i got the challenge to get to 95 pounds
but it is so simple that every time i connect to send my information to google health
and my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time where you need care of <unk> or some urgency of that style but see it backwards
but there is another thing
as some of you know i have got more than 4,000 followers on twitter
so every morning i connect to my wi fi scale and before you go up to my car people start to talk to me <unk> today i think you need a light lunch
that is the best thing that can happen because it is about peer pressure to help patients because it could be used for obesity and also for patients stop smoking
on the other hand can <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health
from the next week being available
this little <unk> connected to an iphone or another device
and people will be able to be able to get their own blood pressure <unk> to their doctor and share it with others for example for 100 dollars
this is the point where patients assume a position come back to reclaim the control and to be captains of their own boat but it can also help us care of health because of the challenges that we face like the firing of the cost of attention to <unk> attention the doubling of demand and other issues
making techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team
and they can do it with techniques like these but also through crowdsourcing
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you with you with a video
we all have shipping controls in cars
maybe we will even have our cell phones
we know it perfectly where are atms in <unk>
also where are you all <unk>
and of course we can find food food chains
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient
we ask but nobody knew
nobody knew where to get the <unk> save lives right now
so what we did is do new approaches in the netherlands
we created a website and we asked the audience that if you see a <unk> please let us go out where and when it is open because they sometimes open up in front office and others are closed
and more than 10,000 <unk> already introduced in the netherlands
the next step was to look for application for that
and we did an application for the ipad
we created an application for <unk> augmented reality to find these <unk>
and every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone collapses you can use your iphone and the next weeks to use its microsoft cell phone to find the closest <unk> which can save lives
and from today i would like to present this not just as much as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product but also as <unk>
and we want to go globally globally
we are talking to all the colleagues in the world in the world in other universities to help us find work and act like a center for the crowdsourcing of <unk> around the world
every time you are on vacation and someone collapses it can be a relative or someone in front of you can find it
i would also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
they might be peer services or mobile people for example to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place
please help us in this and not only improve health but take control of it
thank you very much
i am here to share my photograph
or it is photography
because of course they are photographs that can not take their cameras
my interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years
i mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when i use the camera the process was in planning
and when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the trigger
for me photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time
i thought anyone could do it
so i wanted to create something different a process that i would start to press the trigger
pictures like this one building on a very <unk> road
but it has an unexpected twist
and even though it keeps a level of realism
or pictures like these dark colorful and colorful but with the common goal to keep the level of realism
and when i say realism i say picture realism
because of course it is not something that i can be able to do but i always want it to seem to have been captured somehow as a photograph
i will have to think of you a moment to discover the trick
it has more to do with capturing an idea that i will be able to capture a moment
but what is the trick that makes it real
they are the details or the colors
it enters the light
what creates the illusion
sometimes the illusion is perspective
but ultimately it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a two dimensional surface
it is actually not about whether it is realistic but what we think is realistic
so i think the foundations are very simple
i see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality
let me show you a simple example
here we have three perfectly imaginable something that we can all relate to the three dimensional world
but combined they can create something that still seems three dimensional as if there was there
but at the same time we know it does not exist
so we deceive the brain because the brain does not accept the fact that it really does not make sense
and i see the same process by combining the photographs
it is really about combining different realities
and the things that make a photo look realistic i think they are those ones that we do not even think of the things that we are around us in our everyday lives
but when you combine photographs it is very important to think about it because otherwise something will be wrong
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes
as you can see these images are not very special
but they combined they can create something like this
so the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective
second the photos combined must have the same kind of light
and these two images play with these requirements were taken in the same height and with the same kind of light
the third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect union
it has to be impossible to see where the image was made
this is another example
you might think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is manipulated
but this picture is totally composed of different places
in the staff i think it is easier to create a place to find it because you do not need to put in danger the ideas that is in the head
but it takes a lot of planning
and as i thought this idea in winter i knew that i had several months to try to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces
for example the fish was captured on a fishing journey
the shores are a different location
the <unk> part was captured in a stone pump
and yes i even made red the house of the top of the island so it seems more swedish
so to achieve a realistic outcome i think we need planning
you always start with a sketch an idea
then you have to combine the different photographs
and here each piece is very good meant
if you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and very realistic
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination
thank you
i will start showing you a slide about very boring technology
please if you can put it
it is a diagram anyone who took from a folder of mine
i am not really interested to show you the details but the general thing
it is an analysis that we were doing about the power of technical microprocessors versus the power of local area networks
what is interesting about this is that this one like a lot of other people we tend to see is a straight line on scale scale
in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude in the performance scale
talking about technology with curves <unk> is a new thing
here's something strange
and that is what i am going to talk about
please light on the lights
it would need more intensity because writing about paper
why we plot technological curves at <unk> scales
the answer is if you draw them on a normal curve where say these are the years or some unit of time and this would be any extent of the technology that i would like to plot the diagram would look something ridiculous
it would be something like this
it does not say a lot
but if you plot for example some other technology like transportation in a <unk> curve it would be very stupid we would see a straight line
but if something happens like this gives a qualitative change
if the technology of transport is as fast as the past microprocessors we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds
but it is not going to that pace
there is no precedent in the history of technological development of growth that every few years of progress of magnitude
the question i want to argue is by looking at these exponential curves we see they are not forever
it is not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes
it will happen one of two things
or well it will become a typical curve i know like this until something completely different or maybe i will do something like this
that is all that it can happen
i am optimistic so i think maybe something will happen
so we are now in the middle of a transition
in this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world to a new way
so what i am trying to ask and wonder is what is that new way that takes the world
what new state is headed the world
the transition seems very very fuzzy if we are engaged in it
i remember that as a child the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000
this is a conference where people talk about the future and we see the future is still the year 2000
that is all we see
in other words the future has halved year after year in my life
but i think it is because we feel something that is happening
a transformation we can feel it
and we know it does not make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it is going to be so different that extrapolate what we are doing today does not make any sense
so i want to talk to you about how it might be how could that transition that we experience
but to do that i will have to talk a little bit about things that do not have much to do with technology and computer technology
because i think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term
the scale of time i would like to do that is the time of life on earth
i think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years
so we are going back a half billion years when the earth was a great sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are going around around him
if we look at the way those chemicals organized us with an idea of how things happened
and i think there are theories to start to understand the origin with rna i am going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that at the time there was floating a little bit of oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes inside
some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring materials from the outside and so the blobs grew up
and they started divided
in some sense those were the most primitive cell forms these <unk> oil
but those blobs were not alive in the current sense because each one of them contained a random chemical recipe
and every time they have divided to a unequal distribution of chemicals that had been held
so every droplet was a little bit different
in fact the blobs that somehow become better at the time to bring the chemicals around them grew up more separate more chemicals and more divided
they were often more represented
it was a way of life life very simple chemical life but things get interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction
in some ways we do not understand very well they learned to store information
they learned to keep information that was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called dna
in other words they worked in this pointless evolution a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to replicate
the amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago
our recipe our genes have exactly the same code that same writing system
in fact every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code
and one of the things i did just for fun now we can write things with this code
so here i have a hundred white powder that i try to hide at the security people in the airport
but it contains this code the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this and i wrote my personal data in this piece of dna and <unk> 10 to 22 times
so if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card i have a lot of them in fact for every person in the world and it is here
if it was a <unk> i would have put it in a virus and it would have spread it in the room
what was the next step
writing dna was an interesting step
this made these cells happy another billion years
but then there was another big step that is interesting where things become very different and that is that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming information forming
i do not know if you know it but bacteria can exchange dna
so for example we have evolved antibiotic resistance
some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their small dna with other bacteria and now there is a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate
this communication gave place that they would train communities that in a way were put together in that and established a synergy
in that way to survive or <unk> together or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would say more and they were <unk> by evolution
and the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that in fact they came together and they decided to write the entire recipe in the community together in a chain of dna
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years
and at that stage we have multicellular communities communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism
in fact we are a multi cellular community
we have a lot of cells that do not act alone
the skin cell does not work without the heart of the heart or the brain or the brain and so on
so these communities evolved and there were more interesting levels that cell phone something we call an organism
the next level happened inside these communities
so they started <unk> information
and to build very special structures that they did not do more than processing information in community
it is neural structures
neurons are the appliances that they process the information that those cell phones built
in fact they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to register and convey the information
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage
because at that time as individuals learning was confined to the duration of an organism and not the period of evolutionary time
so an organism could for example learn to not eat some fruit because i knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it
that could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit
so the fact that the nervous system built those information structures it accelerated the evolutionary process
because evolution could now happen to be confined to an individual
it could happen in the time necessary to learn
but then of course the individuals discovered the trick of communication
so for example the most refined version that we know is human language
if we think about it it is an incredible invention
i have a very complicated idea a vague idea in your head
i am sitting here and i am sitting in emitting and hopefully building a similar idea vague and fuzzy in their heads that is sort of a analogy to me
but we took something very complicated we turned it into sound in sound sequences and we produce something very complicated in another brain
that now allows us to work as a organism
in fact as humanity we have started to do abstractions
now we spend through similar periods to the multicellular organisms we abstract our record methods and information processing and information processing
for example the invention of language was a little step in that direction
the telephony the computer games the cd rom and so forth are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information
and that brings us into something much larger faster and able to evolve more than we did before
now evolution can happen in microseconds
you already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution has done with the <unk> program in front of our eyes
and now we have accelerated scales of time again
the first stages of the story that i told them took a billion years each one
the next stages the nervous system and the brain took about hundreds of millions of years
the next language and so on took less than a million years
and the next bit like electronics seems to take a few decades
the process gets extinct i guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change
the more it changes faster it does it
and i think that is what we are looking at in this explosion of the curve
we see the process gets feeds
but i make life designing computers and i know that the mechanisms that work for them would not be possible without the recent computer advances
but now now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me by design
i do not know that every transistor does in that machine of connections
there are billions
instead of that with designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you can not get much further and faster than ever before
in fact sometimes employs methods that we do not even understand well
a particularly interesting approach i have been using lately is evolution itself
we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds
and for example in the most extreme cases we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions
we say please computer you can run a hundred million random instructions
you could run these things of instructions at random to run all those programs and take the ones that we are more likely to do to what we want to do
in other words i define what i want
let us say i want to order numbers to put a simple example
so we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers
of course it is unlikely to be a few random sequences of instructions and so none of them did it
but one luckily he could find two numbers in the order right
and i said computer you could take 10 of those random sequences that better did the task
let us take those and <unk> the rest
and now we are going to get the best to ask the numbers
and let us go back to <unk> following a process of recombination analog to sex
let us take two programs that <unk> children who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will be able to do the properties of both of the programs
so we got a new generation of programs that are product of combinations that had a little more successful
and we say please repeat the process
eve again
you put some mutations
and it is trying to try and get it to another generation
well every generation takes a few milliseconds
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours
at the end we ended up with programs that are made absolutely perfect
in fact they are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand
if i look at those programs i can not say how do they work
i have tried to analyze it to see how they work
they are dark dark programs
but they have got the committed
in fact i know i have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it
in fact their lives are dependent on doing it
i once was on a 747 with depressed and you get a card and he says look at this
he says this plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a safe flight does not make you feel cool
we know that engineering processes do not work very well when they become complicated
so we started to depend on computers to make design processes different
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than produces normal engineering
yet we do not understand the whole choices there is
in that sense it is in front of us
now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly
it is <unk>
the thing is getting faster and so i think it seems so fuzzy
because all of these technologies are fed up
we are taking off
and we are at an analog moment to the cell organisms when they got multicellular
we are the amoebas and we can not understand what the hell we are creating
we are at the tipping point
but i think something comes behind us
i think it would be very arrogant of our part to think that we are the final product of evolution
and i think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is
but now he comes lunch and i think stop here before i am going to get myself
i think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change
and i think this starts with a doctor and that is me
and i have spent time enough to allow me to give up a part of my false prestige
before i treat the theme of my talk let us talk a little baseball
why not
we are close to the end it is approaching the world series
we love baseball right
baseball is full of amazing statistics
there are hundreds of statistics
it is going breaking the rules talk about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team
i am going to focus on one of them and i hope many of you know
it is called <unk>
and we are talking about 300 percent of a fiber that <unk> 300
that means that the bat <unk> effectively three of 10 times
that means throwing the ball into the game camp without being stuck and that anyone who tries to throw it out at the first base not to time and the second base will be saved
three attempts 10
you know how they call a population of 300 in the big league
well really well maybe the team of stars
you know how they call a baseball switch
by the way that is somebody who is 10 strokes it is four
legendary ted williams the last ted league player in running more 400 hits in a regular season
now let me take this to my world of medicine where i feel much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward after what i am going to tell you today
suppose you have appendicitis and they are derivatives of a surgeon that has a 400 <unk> record
it does not work right
now suppose that they live in a place a little bit away and a loved one has two <unk> heart arteries and your family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200
but you know something
she is getting dramatically this year
and their hits have been <unk>
this is not working
but i will ask you
what do you think it must be the average of a heart surgeon or a prosthetic surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
1,000 very well
and the truth of the issue is that nobody in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon for a doctor or a care
what we do however is send them to the world and i include myself with the mandate of being perfect
they never ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right
that was the message that we were looking at when i was in medical school
i was an obsessive fulfilling student
once a fellow in high school said that brian sachs studied until a blood test

i was studying in my little <unk> in the residence of nurses general in toronto not far from here
and i learned all of memory
from my kind of anatomy i memorized the origin and the muscle work the <unk> of every artery that comes out of your aorta the diagnostic diagnosis and non usual
and i even knew a differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk>
and as much as you get more knowledge more knowledge
and i was very well i graduated with june
and you know <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were going to know everything they would know everything or as soon as you can close to the whole thing because i am going to get rid of the mistakes
and it worked for a while until i met mrs <unk>
i was a resident at a college hospital here in toronto when they brought to the lady in toronto where i was working
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service
and when emergency emergency i asked a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist
and to inform the chief of residents
when i saw mrs <unk> was not quite
i heard a <unk> sound
and when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound on both sides what is going to give me a heart failure
in these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward to the blood goes to the lungs they are filled with blood and so there is so hard to breathe
and it was not hard to diagnose
i did it and i started working on the treatment i would give him
i gave him aspirin and medication to ease the pressure in your heart
i gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid
and in an hour or two she started feeling better
and i felt very well
and that is when i made the first mistake he sent her home
i actually made two mistakes
he sent her home without talking to the chief of residents
i did not get up the phone i did not have what i should have done to call my boss and <unk> with him so he saw it
and if my boss would have seen it would have been able to be able to tell you
maybe i did it for a good reason
maybe i did not want to be a resident that is constant attention
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility that i could take care of my patients without even contact my boss
the second mistake i made was worse
by send it home to a voice i am not paying attention to a voice in my interior which he said to me is not a good idea do not do it
in fact i was so insecure that until i asked the nurse i was taking care of the lady who was taking care of the lady you think it is okay if you go home
and the nurse thought and then he said total <unk> yeah i think i am going to be good
i remember that as if it was yesterday
so i signed up the high and the ambulance along with the ambulance they took her home
and i went back to the hospital room
the rest of that day i had a bad feeling in the stomach
but i went on with my job
at the end of the day i packed it to leave the hospital and i walked into the parking lot where i was my car to go home at that point i did something i do not usually do
i went through emergency emergency service
and there is another nurse not that i was taking care of mrs <unk> before but another one told me three words those three words that most emergency doctors fear
other specialists fear but there is a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see the patients <unk>
the three words are remember you
remember the patient he sent home
i asked the other nurse with total <unk>
well she came back with the same tone of voice
she was okay
but i went back and on the edge of death
after an hour of an hour of having come to his house after i gave her high suffered a collapse and his family called 911 and they brought her into emergency room with a 50 mm blood pressure which means a severe shock
i just breathe and i was blue
the emergency personnel would go through all their resources
they gave up medication to raise your blood pressure
and they put an artificial shower
i was shocked and <unk> to the spinal cord
i had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and she hoped for all hope he would recover
and in the two or three days it was obvious that i would never afford
it had irreversible brain damage
the family got together
and in eight or nine days it was going to be <unk> to what was happening
and in the ninth day he left the lady <unk> wife mother and grandmother
they say they never forget the names that they die
that was my first experience
the next few weeks i am going to tell you about it and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy embarrassment that exists in our medical culture and i felt just isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can not afford it with your colleagues
you make peace and never more make that mistake
it is that shame that leaves a teaching
the unhealthy shame i am talking about is that makes us feel very bad inside
it is the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong but we are bad
and that i felt
and it was not for my boss he was an charm
i talked to the family and i am sure i am going to get the things out and made sure that i did not get away
and i kept asking those questions
why did not i ask my boss why did he send him home
and in my worst moments why i made such a silly mistake
why did i choose medicine
gradually that feeling was <unk>
and i started to feel better
and in a cloudy day he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and i wondered if i would feel better again
and i did a deal with myself in which if we were going to get the efforts to be perfect to make more mistakes i would make those voices
and that was that
i went back to work
but it came back again
two years later i was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern toronto and i got a 25 year old man with a pain
i was very busy and a hurry
and he pointed out here
i watched her throat i was a little bit <unk>
he was <unk> penicillin and sent him home
but while he went to the door he kept pointing his throat
two days later when i came to do my guard change my boss asked to talk to me with me to be able to talk to me in his office
and he made the three words remember you
remember the patient he saw by a pain in the throat
well he went back and i did not have a <unk> <unk>
i had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
you can look for it in google it is an infection not from your throat but from the upper air and it can because the close of those pathways
he fortunately did not die
it was managed antibiotics for <unk> and recovered and recovered
and i went through the same period of shame and <unk> and i went back to work until it happened again and again and again
twice the same shift in the emergency shift they do not have appendicitis
and it is a big effort especially working in a hospital because they are going to 14 patients at the same time
but in both cases i did not send them home and i do not think there is been a carelessness
one of them thought i had a kidney calculation
there is an x ray of kidneys but it was normal a colleague who was checking the patient would have some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea
he is order to <unk> it and i asked my colleague to take it
i checked it and when i notice some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant called the surgeon
they were both operated and they recovered well
but every single case i devoured <unk>
but i would like to tell you i made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say it is a crap
the most significant have been over the last five years
just ashamed and no support
and here's the problem if i can not release them and talk about my mistakes if i can not find the voice that tells me what is really going to be able to share this with my colleagues
how do i show them this to do not make the same mistakes
if i would come into a place like this i would have no idea what you think about me
when was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure after failure after failure
of course in a party you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors but you will not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes
and if i knew and my colleagues also a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg believe me i would have difficulty looking at it
this is the system we have
the total denial of mistakes
it is the system in which there are two positions that they make mistakes and those who can not sleep and the ones that they have fewer results and the ones that have great results
and it is almost like a ideological reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person
we have the idea that if you step out of medicine to the people who make mistakes we will become a safe system
but that brings two problems
in 20 years about spreading medical journalism and medical research i have done a bad lush medical study and errors and medical errors to learn how it was possible from the first article that i wrote for the back star to my white show <unk> black art white black art
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous
we work in a system where mistakes happen every day in which one in 10 drugs is wrong or the ladder is not right in a system where the hospital acquired hospital infections are increasingly more and more numerous causing chaos and death
in this country 24 canadian canadian errors are preventable
the you.s institute in america established 100,000
in both cases it is about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should
and so they are things
a hospitable system where knowledge is divided every two or three and three years and we do not discount
sleep deprivation comes all
and we can not get rid of it
we have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest
now let us take the same patient with a chest pain comes alive with <unk> eyes and my breath to alcohol and all of a sudden my story was <unk> from contempt
it is not the same story
i am not a robot i do not do things always like it
and my patients are not cars they do not want their symptoms always in the same way
all of these things are inevitable
so if we take the system as we were taught and we eliminate all the professionals prone to error well no one
and that is what people do not want to talk about their most serious cases
in my <unk> white art show it is a habit saying this is my worst mistake i would say to all of the ambulance to the chief of heart surgery this is my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what are your mistakes and <unk> the microphone to them
and their students got <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories
they want to tell their stories they want to share them
they want to be able to say look do not make the same mistake
they need a context where they can do it
they need a medical culture
and it starts with a doctor every time
the physician redefined is human you know it is human he accepts it and not proud of his mistakes but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others
they share their experiences with them
it is support for those who talk about their mistakes
it points the mistakes of other people not with intent to catch it but in a loving and support way for everyone to benefit
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system and when this happens they make mistakes at the time
my name is brian sachs
i am an redefined doctor
i am a human make mistakes
and i am sorry so much but i strive to learn something that can convey to others
i do not know what you think about me but i can live with that
and let me conclude with three words personal i remember it
you know how many decisions take one day
you know how much we choose in a week
i recently made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that says to pick an american american is about 70 percent
it does not do a lot of research on a research followed by a group of business presidents
researchers recorded the different tasks <unk> by these executives and the time that we are going to make decisions related to those ceos
they found that on average <unk> <unk> jobs a week
of course every single job included lots of <unk>
half of those decisions took nine minutes or less
only 12 required an hour or more of their time
now think about your choices
you know how many they belong to the category of nine minutes and how many of an hour
how do you write the way to make those decisions
today i want to talk about one of the biggest problems i want to talk about the overload of choice
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions
while i talk about this i am going to ask you a few questions and i need to know your answers
when i ask a question as i am blind hands up just if you want to burn calories
in another way when you ask a question if your answer is positive please give you a pat
and now my first question of the day are you ready to hear about the problem of options
thank you
being a graduate student at stanford university <unk> this high level supermarket at least at the time it was very sophisticated
it was called <unk>
it was almost like going to a amusement park
there were like 250 different mustard and vinegar over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and some 25 of bottled water and this was when we were taking water from the faucet
i loved going to that store but on one occasion i asked myself why i never buy anything
this is the olive oil shelf
they had more than 75 different classes including the ones that were in sealed box that came from trees millennials
i once decided to visit the manager and i asked him works well this strategy of offering all of these options
he pointed to the buses full of tourists that came every day usually with their cameras
we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> this is the one
hallway
they had different classes
we installed a fit for <unk> right at the car entrance
we put out of six flavors or 24 different flavors and we saw two things first in what case people were willing to stop testing the jelly
more people stopped when there was 24 60 percent when there were only six 40
we also looked at what if they were more likely to buy a jelly paste
here's the opposite effect
from those who stopped when there were 24 only three came to buy jelly
when i stood up when there were six we saw 30 percent bought jelly
if we do the calculations people had six times more likely to buy jelly if they found six who if they found 24
well let us decide that we do not buy jelly and we probably want to get it less it is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in real life decisions
we decided to do not even decide yet when this is not being done
now the issue of the day the financial savings
i am going to describe to you a study that i did with guru <unk> <unk> <unk> and wei wei where we are looking at their decisions about savings for a million americans in between some 650 plans of this country
we were interested in looking at if the number of funding available in support plans for retirement the <unk> <unk> program people save for the future
and we found that in truth there was a correlation
we had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options
we found that the older it was the number of funds to be used at least participation
so if you look at the extremes we see that in the plans that they offer two funds the rate of participation was 70 percent or more not as high as i would like
and in the plans that offered about 60 funds the rate of participation dropped to the 50th percentile
it turns out that even if you decide to participate when you have more choices even in that case there are negative consequences
so for those who decided to participate in the number of choices more people will be able to avoid actions or investment funds
in the way we would have more options they were more willing to invest in market bills
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are supposed to optimize the future financial well being
in the previous decade we have seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities
the most likely thing is that we make the decision that <unk> even when this goes against self interest
it is more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health
they are more likely to pick things less satisfying even though i did not go better
the main reason is that we enjoy looking at that gigantic array of <unk> mustard vinegar and jelly but we are not able to do the calculations to compare contrast and choose from that awesome exhibition
i want to propose to you today four simple techniques that we have tried in a way or another in different research so you can test in their business
the first is cut
you have heard it before but it has never been more true than today less
people are always upset when i say cut
they care about losing space in <unk>
but actually what we are looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut rid of you get rid of you get rid of you get a lot of weird redundant options there will be a increase in the cost of sales there will be a better experience in choice
when <unk> gamble went from 26 different types of head 15 to 15 saw a 10 percent increase in sales
when the golden corporation remember the products for cats of cats that less sold to be increased for the profit in 87 by two larger causes and smaller costs
you know supermarkets on average are offering 45 <unk> products
in a shop store you are offering about 100,000 products
but the ninth store bigger in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 products a type of tomato sauce
in the world in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that have come up about how to handle the choices is the title of david <unk> the harvard program
all the harvard employees are embedded automatically to a safe insurance fund
you who really want to choose you are offered 20 funds not 300 or more
you know often people say i do not know how to cut off
they are all important options
the first thing i do is ask employees tell me the differences that there are between those choices
and if your employees can not tell the difference they can not do their customers
this evening before i started this session i was talking to gary
he said to me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience for a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world
here's a description
i want you to read it
i am going to leave a few seconds to read it and then i want you to take a hand if you are ready to take the supply of gary
a few ok anybody who is ready to accept the supply
they are not more
well i am going to show you something else
you know there was a trick
who is ready for that journey
i think i would actually hear more hands
all right
actually you had more information in the first round than in the second one but i can tell you what they thought the second time was more real
because the images made it more real
this brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the overload of options which is <unk>
so people understand differences between options they have to understand the consequences of each option and that the consequences must feel very vivid very concrete
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use credit cards or credit or credit that when you use cash
because it does not seem real money
it turns out that making it more real it can be a very positive tool for people to save more
we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being tested by a 401 plan
to that meeting we would save exactly how we used to do a small addition
what we added was we appeal to the staff to think about the positive things that we would spend in their lives if they were saving more money
with this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts
the third technique is to rank
we can handle more categories than options
for example this is a study we did in a magazines of magazines
we saw that in supermarkets <unk> along the northeast of the northeast of magazines can contain from 331 different types to <unk>
but you know
because the classification tells me how to tell
these are two jewelry exhibitions
one is called jazz and the other beat
if you think the one on the left is beat and the one on the right it is jazz you will shake it
a few applause well there are some
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> shake
well something else
it turns out it is right
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something
this classification scheme is totally useless
the categories must indicate something you choose not to do that it is defined
you often see this problem with those huge funds
supposedly who are reporting
my fourth category <unk> complexity
it turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if you just take it a little bit
we have to increase complexity gradually
i am going to show you an example of what i mean
let us look at a very complicated decision the purchase of a car
this is a german manufacturer of cars that allow them completely completely
you have to take 60 decisions to build the car
and these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one
color outside the car i have 56 possibilities
you motor changes four choices
what i am going to do is to vary the order that decisions appear
so half of the clients are going to go from many options 56 colors a few four boxes
the other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices four boxes to 56 colors a lot of options
and what am i going to look at
how do you get involved
if you are always going to get the default button in every decision this indicates you are overwhelmed or we are losing them
we found that the ones that are going to be a lot of options in a few options put the default button over and over again and another
we lose
if you go from a few options you are still there
same information the same number of options
the only thing i did was disrupt the order in which information is presented
if we start with easy you learn to choose
even though the choice of change does not say anything about the preferences of interior decoration in all ways it makes us a choice
we are excited about a product that we are building that now has more engaged in the process
so let me summarize
i have talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of choice of choice to cut out strange alternatives <unk> to make it real classify we can handle more categories with less options <unk> complexity
all these techniques that i have presented to them were designed to help manage alternatives or better for you to use them in their own issues or for people who serve
it is i think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful when you choose
and the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice
thank you very much
in the 80s in the 1980s in the eastern communist germany if you had a write machine i should be able to get it to the government
i had to register a page of text of example written with the machine
and this for the government could track the origin of texts
if they found a script with the wrong message you might track the footprint to the origin of the idea
in the west we do not think that someone could do this how much it will make freedom of expression
we would never do that in our countries
but today if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page that page will end up having a few yellow print on every page that you follow up a pattern that makes you one and your printer
that is happening today
and nobody looks very much like this
this is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us citizens
and it is one of the three major causes of problems in the network
if we see what happens in the online world we can set together the attacks according to their attackers
there are three main groups
they are the cybercriminals
like mr dimitry <unk> from the city of kiev in ukraine
the mobile phone is very easy to understand
these guys make money
they use cyberattacks to make a lot of money a lot of money
there is really many cases of millionaires on a <unk> line that we will make money with their attacks
this is van <unk> from <unk> estonia
this is alfred probable
this is stephen watt
this is <unk> <unk>
these are matthew anderson <unk> and etc etc etc etc
these guys make their fortunes online but they do it by illegal means by banking trojans to steal money from our accounts when we buy online or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a living computer
the secret service of the united states two months ago sparked the swiss account of this mr sam jain and this account had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen
mr jain comes out you do not know his stop
and i say today it is more likely than any of us be a victim of a real crime
and it is very obvious that this is going wrong
in the future most of the crimes will happen online
the second group of attackers in importance we see today is not driven by money
there is another thing that makes them motivate the protests they motivate them to motivate them the opinions they motivate them
groups like anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in online attacks
those are the three major bombers criminals who make it for money the <unk> like anonymous they do to protest and the last group are the national states governments who attack
and then we see cases like <unk>
that is a good example of government attack against their own citizens
<unk> is an authority of certification in the netherlands or actually it was
he declared court the last fall because of a <unk>
they <unk> the security of the site and provide a <unk>
last week i asked myself in a meeting with representative of the dutch government asked one of the leaders if you found the death of people to because of the attack to <unk>
and the answer of him was yes
so how do people die because of a attack of these
<unk> is an <unk> authority
they sell a certificate
what do the certificates serve
well you need if you have a website with <unk> services <unk> services like gmail
except for me to raise a foreign <unk> authority
and they would be able to get them out
and in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that
and what happened in the arab spring and those things that have happened for example in egypt
well in egypt the you.s secret police headquarters in april 2011 and during the northeast of the building they found a lot of papers
between those papers was this folder called <unk>
and within that folder there were notes in a company based in germany that had sold the egyptian government tools to intercept large scale communications in the country
they had sold this tool for 280 euros the egyptian government
the company headquarters is right here
so western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens
but western governments are also doing this to themselves
for example in germany just a couple of weeks ago i found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens
if you are suspicious in a criminal case well it is pretty obvious that your phone is intervened
but today it goes beyond
the internet is <unk>
they use even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication and listen online to get our data
when we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be good it seems bad but actually it does not affect me because i am an honest citizen
why to worry about
i have nothing to hide
and that argument does not make sense
it is in play
privacy is not arguing
it is not a matter of privacy against security
it is about freedom against control
well if we could trust our governments today in 2011 any right that we will agree to be forever
they are blindly blindly at any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years
these are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years
this is where i live in kenya in kenya in the south of national park in nairobi
these are the cows of my dad at the bottom and behind the cows the national park in nairobi
the national park in nairobi has not fences in the most south part of the south which means that wild animals like the grime migrate freely outside the park
and predators like lions are following and this is what they do
they kill our cattle
this is one that they killed at night and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead i felt very bad because it was the only bull that we had
my community the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for us and so we value them so much
so i grew up to hate lions
they died they are warriors that protect our community and livestock and they are also upset with the problem
so they kill lions
this is one of the six lions who killed in nairobi
i think this is why there are so few in the national park in nairobi
a child in my community of six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing that happened to me
so i had to find a way to solve this problem
my first idea was to use fire because i thought that lions were afraid
but i realized that actually this did not work because even helped lions to see the barn
i did not give up i went on
a second idea was to use a <unk>
i was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the barn
but lions are very smart they came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were but the second day they came back and they said this thing is not moving it is always here so i jumped and killed animals
so one night i was walking around the barn with a torch and that day the lions did not come
i discovered that lions are afraid of light moving
so i had an idea
and i got a switch to turn on and turn the lights off
and this is a little lamp of a broken flashlight
i put up all
as you can see the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box <unk> i call it a transformative
and the <unk> box makes <unk> lights
as you can see the <unk> give them out because that is where lions come from
and that is how you see what lions when they come from night
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think i am walking around the barn but i am sleeping in my bed
thank you
so i put them in my house two years ago and since then we never went back to having problems with lions
and the houses in the neighborhood have heard the idea
one of them is this grandmother
she had killed a lot of animals lions and asked me if i could put the lights down
i said yes
i put them you can see the background these are the lights for lions
since i have been installed in seven houses in my community and they are serving a lot
and my idea is also used now by all kenya to scare other predators like hyenas leopards and it is also using to scare elephants from the farms
because of this invention i was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya <unk> school and i am very excited
my new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
i even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that do not have and i teach them how to put them
so a year ago i was just a child on the meadows of the savanna the cows of my father and i used to see airplanes to fly and he said someday i would be inside one
and today i am here
i got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at ted
my great dream is to get to be an engineer to aviation and pilot when it grows
i used to hate lions but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and lions we can be with lions without any conflict
<unk> <unk> what in my tongue means thank you very much
chris anderson you do not picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you
so you got a scholarship richard <unk> yeah
ca are you working on other inventions electric inventions
what is the next on your list
<unk> my next invention i want to do a near electrical ca i want to do a near electrical
<unk> i know that it is already invented electrical fences but i want to make mine
ca now you know it once right and you have tried i have tried it before but i got a little bit because i got a <unk> ca richard canyon richard <unk> you are something big
we are going to take it in every step that i will give you a friend of mine
thank you very much thank you very much
when i was small i thought my country was the best of the planet
and i grew up singing a song called <unk> nothing
and i felt very proud
in school we spent all the time studying the history of kim ii sung but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world except america south korea japan are the enemies
although i was going to ask myself about the rest of the world i thought it would happen all my life in north korea until everything changed all of a sudden
when i was seven years old i saw my first public performance
but i thought my life in north korea was normal
my family was not poor and i myself had never been hungry
but one day in 1995 my mom brought home a letter from my sister
he said when i did this the five members of the family will stop there in this world because we have not eaten in the two weeks
we are <unk> together on the floor and our bodies are so weak that we are prepared to die
it was very altered
it was the first time i heard people were suffering in my country
when i was walking in front of the train station i saw something terrible that i can not erase my memory
a woman without life was dead in the street holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything
nobody helped them because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families
a huge famine contacted north korea in the middle of the 90s
at the end of a million north koreans died during the famine and only few survived eating grass insects and tree cortex
they also became more and more frequent the energy breaks all around me was completely at dark at night except for sea lights in china just crossing the river from my house
i always wondered why they had light and we did not
this is a satellite picture of north korea at night compared to the countries
this is the <unk> river that serves between north korea and china
as you can see the river can be very narrow in certain points allowing north koreans to cross secretly
but many die
sometimes i saw bodies floating in the river
i can not reveal the details of how i went out of north korea but i can only say that during the years of starvation i was sent to china to live with distant relatives
but i just thought i would be separate from my family for short time
i could never imagine that i would take 14 years to live together
in china it was hard to live as a young woman without my family
i had no idea what life is like refugee <unk>
but soon i learned that it is not just extremely difficult but also dangerous because refugee refugees in china were considered illegal immigrants
so i was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in north korea
one day my worst nightmare was actually done when i was arrested by the chinese police and i was going into the police station
somebody had accused me for being <unk> then i am going to get my skills in the chinese language and made me a lot of questions
i was <unk>
i thought my heart was going to explode
if it did not seem natural it could be incarcerated and <unk>
i thought my life was going to finish
but i managed to control my emotions and said questions
at the end of the interrogation a officer said to another this was a fake report she is not <unk>
and they left me to go it was a miracle
some north koreans in china are looking for asylum embassy
but many of you may be arrested by the chinese police and deported
these women were very lucky
even though they had captured it they were eventually released after hard international pressure
these north koreans were not so lucky
every year countless koreans are captured in china and deported to north korea where they are tortured or executed in public
although i was lucky to escape many other koreans have not been so lucky
it is tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive
even after learning a new language and finding work all over their world can hold it in a moment
that is why after 10 years of hiding my identity i decided to risk myself going to south korea
and i started a new life again
<unk> in south korea was a much greater challenge than i expected
english was very important in south korea i had to start learning my third language
i also understood that there was a big gap between north and south
we are all koreans but inside we have come to be very different because of 67 years of division
i even went through a identity crisis
i am <unk> or <unk>
where am i who i am
suddenly there was no country i could call it with pride
even though we were looking at the life in south korea was not easy i did a plan i started studying for the university of income
just when i was starting to <unk> my new life i got an alarming call
the north korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family and as punishment my family was going to be displaced by the force to a straight location outside
they had to run away from immediate
so i started planning how to help them escape
north koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom
it is almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea
so ironically i took a flight to china and went to the border with north korea
because my family could not speak chinese i had to put them in some way over 3,000 miles across china and then across southeast asia
the journey in <unk> took a week and we were almost caught several times
once our bus was arrested and approached by a police officer
he asked everybody and started asking them questions
like my family i could not understand chinese i thought my family was arrested
when the chinese officer came up to my buying family i stood up and i told him they were <unk> people who was accompanying
i looked at myself but fortunately he believed me
we did all the way up to the border of laos
but i had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border border guards
but even after spending the border my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border illegally
after paying tickets and bribes my family was released in a month
but in time my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital
this was one of the lowest dots in my life
i did everything i did all of free to my family and we were so close to but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of south korea
i was going and came between the immigration office and the police station desperately trying to liberate my family
but i did not have enough money to pay more bribes or tickets
i lost hope
at that time or the voice of a man asking what is the problem
i was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking
with my poor english and with a dictionary i explained the situation and without doubt the man was the atm and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two north koreans and taking them out of prison
i thank her all my heart and i asked him why do i help him why
i am not helping you
i am helping the people <unk>
i realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life
the stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when we needed it
and i showed that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> village needs
over time after our long journey my family and i met in south korea
but achieving their freedom is only half the battle
a lot of north koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country they start with little or nothing of money
therefore we can benefit from the international community with education language practices practices of work and more and more
we can also act as a bridge between people in north korea and the rest of the world
because many of us are still in touch with family still inside and we sent information and money that is helping to change north korea from the inside
i have been very lucky i have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life so i want to help north koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support
i am sure you are going to see more and more north koreans <unk> around the world including at the ted stage
thank you
i live in south center
this is center in southern food shops rapid food <unk> <unk>
so the planners of the city got together and they thought we are going to change the name of south center so that it represents something else so they changed the south los angeles as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city
this is the los angeles south <unk> stores rapid food
just like <unk> millions of other americans live in a food desert los angeles center south south of food places to carry and eating in the car
the curious thing is that the food places to carry killed more people than food in the car
people are dying of diseases being dying in los angeles south
for example the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say beverly hills which is like 15 miles away
i emphasize what this happens
and i wonder how would you feel if you did not have access to healthy food and if every time they come out of home you see the bad effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood
i see chairs of wheels bought and sold as cars
i see centers centers <unk> like starbucks
and i consider this to stop
i think the problem is the solution
food is the problem and it is the solution
in addition i got tired of running 45 minutes back and forth to buy an apple that does not have pesticides
what i did is plant a forest forest in front of my house
in a joint of land we call a gardening
it is 45 me x 3 me
the point is it belongs to the city
but you have to keep it
i said well i can do what comes to me in win because it is my responsibility and i have to keep it
this is how i decided to keep it
so my group and i l.a green <unk> we get together and we started planting our forest of food trees <unk> you know the nine full vegetables
what we do is we are a kind of paid group in advance made by gardeners of all the backgrounds of all the city and completely volunteer and everything we do is free
and the garden was beautiful
then someone complained
the city got me on top and in summary they gave me a <unk> saying that i had to remove my garden the <unk> made justice
and i said we are going to do it
one order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody matters then i was like well take it away
because this time was not going to happen
l.a times was written by steve <unk> and i talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of the <unk> who put a request in change.org with 900 signatures we were successful
we had the victory in our hands
my <unk> even called to say they supported and they loved what we were doing
i mean we are going why not
l.a is the you.s city with more terrain <unk>
it is 68 miles of <unk> land
that is 20 central parks
that is space enough to plant <unk> million tomato plants
why the hell does not look like this
growing a plant will give a thousand 10,000 seeds
when a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result
it is my anthem when i tell people they cultivate your own food
growing your own food is like print your own money
you see i have a legacy for south center
i grew up there raised my kids there
i am going to be part of this <unk> reality which was <unk> for me and i am going to manufacture my own reality
you see i am an artist
<unk> is my graffiti growing my art
as a graffiti artist that <unk> walls me <unk> <unk>
use the garden the earth as a piece of canvas and the plants and the trees are my <unk> of that canvas
you would be surprised to see what the earth can do if you keep your canvas
you can not imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how does it affect people
what happened
i am a witness of how my garden became a tool of transformation in my neighborhood
to change the community you have to change the composition of the earth
we are the earth
you would be surprised to see how kids affect kids
gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act they can do especially in a <unk>
you also get strawberries
i remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter were like the blades of night and they were in my garden salt and look very <unk>
well i felt bad they were there and i said you know you do not have to do this
this is on the street for a reason
i felt shame when i saw people who was so close to me with hunger and this just reinforces why i do this people ask me no temes that people are going to steal your food
what i say by god i do not fear you are going to steal
so that is on the street
that is what it is about
i want you to take it but at the time i want you to get your health care
there was another time i put a garden in a homeless shelter in the los angeles
they were these guys who helped me download the truck
it was fabulous i shared their stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother and it was fabulous to see how this changed it so just for a moment
so green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 gardens
we have had about 50 people who come to work and they participate all in voluntary plan
if you are going to grow kids they will eat saucers
if they grow tomatoes they will eat tomatoes but if none of this is taught if you are not taught how food affects your mind and your body are blind to blind what they are going to put in front of them
i see young people who want to work but they have this thing where they are stuck i see color guys who are on this path designed for them that does not take them anywhere
with gardening i see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are encouraged by their communities to have a sustainable life
and when we do this who knows
maybe the next george washington is the next george <unk>
but if we do not change the composition of the earth we will never do it
now this is one of my plans this is something i want to do
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share food on the same block
i want to carry containers and turn them into healthy cafes
do not get me wrong
i am not talking about free things because free is not sustainable
the curious thing about sustainability is you have got to do it
what i am talking about is to put people from the street to get the kids out of the street who know joy and pride and honor to grow their own food by opening farmers markets
what i want to do here we have to make it sexy
i want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners
we have to change the script of what is a <unk>
if you are not a gardener you are not a <unk>
the <unk> take their p.a line
that is their weapon of choice
in sum if you want to meet me well if you want to look at me you do not call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk about doing some shit to talk about making some shit
if you want to look at me come to the garden with your baseline that we can plant something
peace thank you
thank you
<unk> <unk> sound probably everyone will agree with me that this is a very nice road
it is made out of asphalt and asphalt is a good material to drive but not always especially in days as today it rains a lot
you can have a lot of water on asphalt that makes it
and especially if you go on on your bike and these cars go on that is not really nice
also asphalt can make a lot of noise
it is a noisy material and if we build roads like in the netherlands very close to the cities we would want a quiet road
the solution for that is to make <unk> highway
the porous porous a material that we use now in most roads in the netherlands has pores and the water can pass through it so all of the rainwater flow down sideways and you will have a road that is easy to drive and not water never more water
noise also disappear in these pores
because it is very hollow all of the noise disappear so it is a very quiet road
it also has disadvantages of course and the downside of this road is that you can get rid of it
what is to get rid of you see that on this road the stones on the surface are coming out
first one stone then several more and more and so on and so on and then well and then well i will not do that but you can hurt your windshield and you will not be happy with that
and finally this can also lead to more and more damage
sometimes they can create bump with that
there it is ready
it is of course that you can become a problem but we have a solution
so here you can actually see how damage appears in this material
it is a porous asphalt as i said so it only has a small amount of <unk> between the stones
because of the same thing to ultraviolet light to iron this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if it sank they will be able to break it up and they will separate
so if you drive around the road you will bring the aggregate as we saw here
to solve this problem we think of <unk> materials
if we can make this material we are going to get out then we will probably have a solution
so what we can do is using steel wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
so we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it
then you need a machine like you see here you are using to cook a induction machine
the induction can heat up especially steel is very good at that
so what you have to do is heat down steel melt the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface
today i used a microwave oven because i can not bring the great bottle of induction here on stage
the microwave oven is a similar system
i put the show that i am now going to take you to see what happened
this is the sample that comes out now
i said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples
we tried a lot of samples there and then the government really saw our results and they thought well that is really interesting we have to try it
so they gave us a piece of road 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a lane lane to test this material
so that is what we did there you see where we were doing the test on the road and then of course this road lasts several years without any damage that is what we know about practice
we took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab
we made the samples we put a lot of charge on them they put them on them then with our induction machine and <unk> them and we went back to test
can we repeat this a lot of times
well to conclude i can tell you that we have done a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers into the energy energy to actually increase the rest of the highway of the highway even you can even double the life of the road you can even save a lot of money with a very simple tricks
and now of course they are curious about if this also worked
we still have the sample here it is pretty hot
it actually has to cool first before i can show you how repairability acts
but i am going to do an attempt
let us see yes it worked
thank you
when i was 11 years old i remember having woken up a morning with the sound of myself in my house
my father was listening bbc news in his little gray radio
i had a great smile in her face that was unusual in those times because the news usually <unk>
the taliban were screamed at my father
i did not know what it meant but i could see my father was very very happy
now yes you can go to a school really he said
one morning i will never forget
a real school
you will see i was six years old when the taliban got out of afghanistan and made it illegal that girls went to school
for the next five years i am going to get myself as a child to educate my older sister who could not be alone outside to go to a secret school
it was the only way we could be educated
every day we take a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were going
we had to hide books in the market bags so it seems that we were shopping
school was in a house of 100 percent of us stuffed in a small room
it was nice in the winter but extremely hot in summer
we all knew that we were going to get our lives the teacher the students and our parents
once in the time school was suddenly suddenly a week because the taliban would
we always wondered what they did from us
they were following us
did you know where we lived
we were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be
i was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a treasure
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time
a total <unk> of a remote province of afghanistan insisted that her daughter my mother was to school and so his father would be <unk>
but my educated mother became a teacher
this is her
it took two years ago just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood
and my father this is the first of all his family to get education
there was no doubt that their children had to receive education even their daughters even though the peril of the risks
for him there was a higher risk not to educate their children
for the years of the taliban i remember there were moments when i was very frustrated about our life and i was always scared and i did not see a future
i wanted to give up but my father said <unk> daughter ma you can lose everything you have in life
they can steal your money they can forcing you to leave your house during a war
but there is one thing that always will be with you what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education we will
so you still want to not continue
i am 22
i grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war
less than six percent of my age have more than high school and if my family had not been so engaged with my education i would be one of them
instead i find myself here proud to graduate college
when i went back to afghanistan my grandfather who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters was one of the first to tell her daughters
he is not just <unk> from my college degree but also that i was the first woman and i am the first woman i carry it on the streets of kabul
my family believe in me
i dream in big but my family has even bigger dreams for me
that is why i am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women
that is why i cofounded the first and maybe the only private school for girls in afghanistan a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school
the exciting thing is i see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity
and i see their parents and their families who like mine would get them through them despite and even in front of a daunting opposition
as ahmed is not your true name and i can not show you your face but ahmed is the father of one of my students
less than a month ago he and his daughter were going on the way from himself to his village and literally had been taken out of being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes
when you get to your house they are the phone a voice told him that if i kept sending her daughter at school they would go back
<unk> if you want he said but do not harm the future of my daughter for the old and <unk> ideas
what i have realized is that i realize afghanistan and it is something that is often forgotten in the west is that behind most of the people we succeeded there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success
it does not mean that our mothers have not been key in our success
in fact often they are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters but in the context of a society like afghanistan we need the support of men
under the taliban the girls who went to school are told in hundreds remember it was illegal
but over three million girls go to school in afghanistan
afghanistan looks so different from here in the you.s
i find that americans see the fragility of changes
i am afraid these changes would not last long after retirement from retirement
but when i go back to afghanistan when i look at students in my school and his parents who are going to be able to be able to get them to a future <unk> future and a lasting change
for me afghanistan it is a country of hope and infinite possibilities and every day girls from used to me
like me they dream big
thank you
i never have i have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile a child out of gaddafi fighting him
but you never go back a revolutionary style
it is almost two years since the revolution broke inspired by the i.q of <unk> mass of the tunisian revolution as the egyptian revolution
a forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and starting a revolution against the <unk> <unk> regime
and we did it was a big revolution
women and young men who were <unk> they were on the cutting edge they are pushing out the fall of the regime carrying billboards of freedom dignity and social justice
they have shown a signed bravery by facing the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the end east to the west to the south
finally after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 people were able to release our country and overthrowing the tyrant
yet gaddafi left a heavy load a legacy of tyranny corruption and seeds of disruption
for four decades the <unk> <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure the culture and the moral structure of society libya
aware of the devastation and the challenges i have loved with many other women to rebuild civil society libya causes a inclusive and inclusive transition to democracy and national reconciliation
there were about 200 organizations in <unk> during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi about 300 in <unk>
after a period of 33 years of exile i went back to libya and a unique enthusiasm i began to organize workshops about development of capabilities and leadership skills
with an amazing group of women we started the platform of women <unk> for peace a movement of women leaders of very diverse orientation to advocate for the women's supply of the woman and by our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace
i found myself with a very difficult environment in the pre election period an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are made of selfish policies of domination and exclusion
over time our initiative was adopted and successful
women won a <unk> of the national congress in the first elections in 52 years
yet gradually the exhilaration of the election and the revolution like a whole day all of the days we were disappearing news news
one day we woke up with the news of <unk> old mosques and graves
another day i am going to have the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on <unk>
another day we woke up with the news of the official officers in the army
and every day every day we woke up with the militias government and their resumes violations of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect for the law
our society made by a revolutionary mindset become more and away from the ideals and the principles of freedom dignity justice social justice that we had at the beginning
intolerance exclusion and revenge and revenge became the icons of the revolution
i am not here today at all to inspire them with our history of success of the list and the election
rather i am here today to tell you that we as a nation we choose to make the wrong decision
we do not prioritize
because the election was not brought the peace the stability and security to libya
the <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and candidates brought peace and reconciliation
they did not do it
what happened then
why do our society continue polarized and dominated with selfish policies of domination and exclusion both by men as women
maybe what was missing was not only women but the female values of compassion for mercy and inclusion
our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the choice that we just needed the polarization and the divide
our nation needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than need the numerical numerical representation of it
we need to stop acting as an outrage of outrage and call it on days of anger
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy
we have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also put it in practice mercy instead of revenge and collaboration instead of competition to inclusion instead of exclusion
these are the ideals that an ecstatic libya for the war needs desperately to achieve peace
because peace has a alchemy that is about the interrelationship of <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives
that is the real <unk>
we need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in the way
according to a verse of the koran <unk> <unk> is the word of god's god <unk> compassionate
at the time the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions it has the same root in arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and motherly and motherly which leads to all of the humanity that men and women who all tribes have <unk>
and so just like the uterus cover completely the embryo that grows into the divine matrix of compassion makes it all existence
so we are telling us my mercy it takes all the things
so we are told my mercy is prevalent about my anger
we would all tell you the grace of mercy
thank you
i am here today to talk to you about a disturbing question that has an equally disturbing response
it is about the secrets of domestic violence and the question i am going to address is that everybody is doing why she is left
why would someone stay with a man who beat it
i am not a psychiatrist or social working or an expert in domestic violence
i am just a woman with a story to tell
i was 22 years old i had just <unk> at harvard university
i had moved to new york for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine
i had my first apartment my first <unk> green express and i had a very big secret
my secret was that many many times the man that i believed my twin soul i was going to put it into my head with charged gun with <unk> bullets
the man who i loved more than anyone in this world put a gun in my head and he threatened to kill me more times than i can remember
i am here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap in love where every year millions of women and even some men
until it could be his story
i do not look like a typical survivor of domestic violence
i am <unk> in english at harvard and i have an mba in marketing business school
i have spent most of my career working for the fortune 500 companies 500 between johnson johnson leo <unk> and the washington post
i have been about 20 years old married my second husband and we have three children
my dog is a black scholar and i drive a <unk> sling
so my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone all races all the religions all income levels and education
it is everywhere
and my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women which is a problem of women
not exactly
over 85 percent of the <unk> are men and domestic abuse only happens in intimate intimate interdependent or said otherwise in the families the last place where we would like or we would expect to find violence why the domestic abuse is so puzzling
i would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who beat him and i was actually a very typical victim because of my age
i was 22 years old and the united states women from between 16 and 24 years old they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples taxi and husbands in the united states
i was also a typical victim because i did not know anything about domestic violence their warning signals or their patterns
i met <unk> on a cold and rainy night in january
i was sitting next to the subway in new york city and he started <unk> with me
he said two things
the first one was that he also had just <unk> from a university of the corporation and i was working on a very important bank of wall street
but what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun and that seemed like a guy in the field
i had some big <unk> like apples and stem hair and it seemed so sweet
one of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning was to create the illusion that i was the dominant component of the partner
he did it mostly at first <unk> on a pedestal
we started to go out and loved everything of me that i was ready to go to harvard who put passion to help teenage girls and my job
i wanted to know all about my family my childhood my dreams and illusions
<unk> believed in me as a writer and as a woman as nobody had ever done it
and that is why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on wall street and his bright future had so much important for him
i did not know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is seduced and <unk> to the victim
and i did not know that the second step is <unk>
now the last thing i wanted to do was i went from new york and leave the work of my dreams but i thought i had to make a sacrifices for your partner so i accepted i quit my job and <unk> and i went together to manhattan
i had no idea that he was falling on a crazy love that was entering head in a financial and financial trap very carefully prepared
the next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts
and here is where these guns come in
as soon as we moved to new england you know that site where i was supposed to feel so safe he bought three guns
i had it in the <unk> of the car
another he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket
and he said i needed those guns to because of the trauma that he lived from small
i needed them to feel safe
but those guns were actually a message for me and even though i had never raised my hand my life was already seriously danger every minute every day
the first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding
it was seven in the morning and i still had the <unk>
five days later when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared i put the girlfriend suit from my mother and i married him
despite what i had happened i was sure we lived happy forever because i loved him and he also wanted me a lot
and i was very very disappointed
there was just a very good sense of your wedding and because of the fact that i have a family with me
it had been an isolated accident and i never would hurt me
i spent two times more on our moon of honey
the first time i was driving up to a secret beach and i lost and he gave me so strong in the head that we would spend several times against the window window
and then a couple of days later driving back on our moon of honey they went through traffic and threw me a big cold mac to the face
<unk> went on a or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage
i am going to tell you when i thought it was the only one in this situation
one in three american women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point of their life and the control center of diseases reported that every year 15 million children are abused 15 million
so i actually had very good company
going back to my question why i got it
the answer is simple
i did not know he was abusing me
instead i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their devils
the other question that everybody does is why it is just not going
why not i left myself at any time
for me this is the saddest and saddest question that people do because we are victims we know something that normally you ignore is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her
more than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has end up to the relationship after getting out because then the <unk> has nothing to lose
other repercussions include the permanent bullying even after the <unk> has come back to death of financial resources and manipulation of the family justice system to <unk> the victim and their children who are normally forced by the judges to spend time did not deal with the man who watches their mother
and yet we keep asking why is it just not going
i was able to go because of one last <unk> beating my denial
i realized that the man who loved a man who would have killed me if he was allowed
so i broke the silence
he told the whole world to the police to my neighbors and family to full unknown and i am here today because all of you helped me
we have the trend to the victims of the victims as a scary headlines women <unk> damaged goods
the question why is there left
for some people it is a way to say guilt is yours for staying as if the victims <unk> intentionally fall in love with men who want to destroy
but since i posted crazy love i have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also escaped that they learned a profound lesson from what happened to them and that we will spend their lives and happily and happy and happily like employed wives and moms completely free of violence like mine
because it turns out that i am a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor
i went back to marry a cute little man and we have those three children
i have got that black labrador and also that <unk>
what i am not going to come back to have never ever is a gun charged by pointing to my head in your hands of someone who says he wants me
right now they are thinking <unk> that is fascinating or <unk> what stupid it was but all this time i have actually been talking about you
i assure you there is a few people who are listening to me right now that are being abused or they were small or they are physical themselves
the abuse could be affecting her daughter to his best friend right now
i was able to end my mad love love breaking the silence
and i keep doing it today
it is my way to help other victims and it is my last request to you
talk about what you have heard here
abuse is only in silence
they have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it
the victims we need everybody
we need each one of you understand the secrets of domestic violence
get the abuse of light talking about it with their children their partners their friends and family
it is <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic and lovely people who have a full future
recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously to slow down their climb and show the victims safe safe
together we can convert our beds our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis that they should be
thank you
hi i call cameron russell and for a while i am a model
to be precise for 10 years
and i feel like that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because i should not have dressed so luckily i brought my clothes to change
this is the first shift of clothing on a ted stage so you have a lot of luck i think
if some of the women were horrified when i came up you do not have to tell now but i will figure out later on twitter
i also want to point out that i have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds
not everybody has that opportunity
these heels are very uncomfortable unless i do not have to use it
the worst part is to pass this sweater to the head because it is when you are going to laugh at me so you do not do anything while i cover your head
all right
why have i done this
it is been embarrassing
well i hope that not as much as this picture
appearance is powerful but also shallow
i have changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds
and in this picture i had never had a boyfriend in real life
i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would sing my back and <unk> the hair
of course with surgery or an artificial tan as i did two days ago for the work there is very little we can do to transform our aspect which although shallow and unchanging has a huge impact on our lives
so today for me to be brave means to be honest
i am on this stage because i am a model
because i am a beautiful white woman and in my labor sector that is a sexy girl
i am going to answer the questions that people always do but in a sincere way
the first question is how do you get to be model
and i always say a <unk> i found myself but that does not mean anything
the real reason i made a model is because i won the genetic lottery and i am the benefit of a heritage and maybe you are wondering what is this heritage
well over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry which are biologically programmed to admire we also have associated with a high and <unk> figure that we have associated with <unk> and a white skin
and that is my heritage heritage that i have known to use to make money
and i know there are people in the audience who are now showing you skeptical and maybe there is some lovers in the fashion that you are waiting wait there are naomi <unk> joan <unk> <unk> controversy
in the first place you know them to know so much of models is amazing
but unfortunately i have to report that in 2007 a ph.d student at the university of new york i said all of the models on the runway and the <unk> models only 27 percent is to say less than four were not white
the next question that people always do is it can be model when it is bigger
and my first answer is i do not know i did not care about it
but then what i would really tell you about every one of these girls is why can you be what you want
you can be president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a <unk> ninja and poet which would be impressive because you are the first one
if after this spectacular list you still do not cameron i want to be a model then i say yes my boss
because i am not in charge of anything and you could be the head of american <unk> magazine or the ceo of <unk> or the next steven <unk>
you know you want to be model it is like saying you want to win the lottery when you are higher
it is out of your control it is amazing and it is not a job you can choose
i am going to demonstrate to you all i learned in 10 years as a model because unlike surgery we can be summarized right now
i do not know what happened there
unfortunately once you have finished your studies and you have got a rsum and a few jobs on your backs no matter what you say is if you said you want to be president of the united states but your rsum would say a model of underwear for 10 years people would look weird
so the next question that people always do is if all the photos are going to be done
and i know essentially all the pictures but that is just a small part of what happens
this was the first picture they took me and also the first time i used a bikini and i did not even have my period yet
i know we are entering the personal terrain but it was a girl
so i looked at my grandmother a few months earlier
these two pictures are the same day
my friend came with me
here i am at a pajamas party a few days before the pictures for french <unk>
here i am with my football team and at the fifth magazine
and this is me today
and i hope you will realize that i am not in those pictures
they are creations from a group of professionals surrounded by photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and pre <unk> and they are able to create this that is not me
well the next question that people always do is you get free things
i have too many eight inches and i will never use except the couple but privilege i get are i get in real life and that we do not like to talk about
i grew up in cambridge and i once went to a store and i forgot to take money and gave me the dress for free
when i was a teenager i was traveling with my friend who was a bad driver he jumped a red light and of course stood and it took a sorry agent so i can keep driving
i enjoy these privilege by my appearance not so i am and there are people who are paying a price for their appearance no matter who they are
i live in new york city and last year of <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 were black and latino and most of them were young men
and there are only <unk> young black and latino people in new york so for them it is not a question of me
but how many times i am going to tell you how many times
when i investigate this talk for this talk i learned that at 53 of the girls in 13 years in the united states they do not like their body and that number goes up at 78 percent
so the last question that people do is what is the life of a model
and i think the answer that you expect is if you are a little thinner and you have got the brighter hair you will feel very happy and great
and behind the cameras we give an answer that maybe it looks like this
we say it is really wonderful to travel and also incredible to be able to work with clever and resourceful people
and all that is true but it is just a part of what happens because what we never say in front of the cameras which i have never said in front of them is i am insecure
and i am because i have to worry about myself every day
and if you ever ask a few thinner legs and the brighter hair will be happier
they just have to come together with a bunch of models because they have the thinner legs the brighter hair and the most brilliant women in fashion but probably the women are physically <unk> on the planet
but especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when i am one of the biggest <unk>
if there is something to hold out of this talk i hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception we have the success and failure
thank you
photography has been my passion since i was older enough to hold a camera but i want to share with you my 15 pictures more precious and i did not have me who pulled them out
there was no artistic directors or <unk> no chance to repeat the photos not even a minimal care in the lighting
in fact most of them took them up tourists at random tourists
my story begins when i met in new york city to give a lecture my wife pulled me out of this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday that is the corner 57 and five percent
he gave the chance that we went back to new york just one year later so we decided to take the same picture
well you can imagine what is coming now
when i was approaching the third birthday of my daughter my wife told me why do not you take me back to new york on a parent father daughter and you continue the ritual
this is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us the picture
it is amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is as universal
never nobody has been denied and fortunately no one has been able to hang on with the camera
so we were not aware of how much we would change life this journey
it became something sacred for us
this picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and i had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so a five year old girl could understand it
these pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey
they are also a way to stop time in a week of october and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years and not only at the physical level but in all the senses
because although we always get the same picture our perspective changes my daughter reaches new milestones and i can see life through his eyes and how do you perceive and interact with everything
that particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all the year
so recently on one of the trips we were walking around when suddenly he stopped dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the hardware store that i loved from little on previous visits
and he described to me what had felt about five years in that same place
i said he remembered his heart <unk> with a force to see that place for the first time nine years ago
and now what you look at in new york are universities because it is determined to study in new york
and suddenly i understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories
so i want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation of memories
i do not know you but apart from these 15 pictures i am not going out in many of the family photos
i am always the one that takes the picture
today i want to encourage you all to appear in the picture and not <unk> in approaching somebody and ask us a picture
thank you
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world
vultures are found in the most threatened bird group
first why do they have so bad press
it is also associated with disney laughter <unk> as characters <unk> stupid stupid stupid
more recently if you have been following the press <unk> laughter and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with the kenyan parliament but i do not accept it
i do not accept it you know why
because the members of parliament do not keep clean the environment they do not help prevent the spread of diseases
it is unlikely to weigh up they are far away from extinct and my favorite vultures have a better presence there are two guys in this planet
there is the vultures of the new world that are primarily found in the americas like the <unk> and the <unk> and those of the old world where we have 16 species of these 16 11 they face a high risk of extinction
so why spiderwebs are important in the first place they provide vital friendly services clean
they are our natural garbage hunter
they clean dead bodies to bone
they help kill all bacteria help to absorb anthrax that would not be for them would spread and it would because large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures people take three to four times more time in broken and this has huge branches in the spread of diseases
vultures also have enormous historical importance
they have been associated with the ancient egyptian culture
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity maternity and along with the king cobra the unit between the top and under egypt
in the hindu mythology of <unk> it was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the goddess of the devil at 10 head <unk>
in the tibetan culture they are doing very important things to open up in the open sky in places like tibet there is no place to bury the dead or wood to be able to get it so these mites provide a natural disposal system
what is the problem with vultures
we have eight species in kenya in kenya which six are in extreme endangered extinction
the reason is that they are being poisoned and the reason they are being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife communities <unk> their venom against predators and as a consequence vultures are victims of this
in southern asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are on the critical list of extinction which means that in less than 10 or 15 years it is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey for the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
this drug has been banned for veterinarian in india and they have taken a position
because there is no eisner there has been a spread in the number of dogs in landfill because when you have dogs on the street you have a huge bomb for rage the number of rage has risen enormously in india
kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa <unk> <unk> will be above lake turkana
i am not against wind energy but we have to work with governments because the wind turbines do this to the birds they cut them in half
they are <unk> birds
in western africa there is a horrible trade of fiji dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market
so what is it doing well we are researching these birds we are <unk> transmitters
we are trying to determine its basic ecology and see where they are going
we can see that they travel through different countries so to focus on a local problem it is not going to be at all
we have to work with governments in the regional levels
we are working with local communities
we are talking to them about appreciating them about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that provide them
how can you help you can become active to make noise you can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very hard creatures to donate their time to spread the word spreading the word
when you go out of this room they will tell you about vultures but talk to their families with their kids on their neighbors
they are very elegant charles darwin said that it changed because he saw flying without effort without any energy spending in the heavens
kenya this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species
thank you very much
every single thing i do as i do professionally my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in africa
since 1971 to 1977 i am young i am not working on zambia kenya coast of ivory algeria and somalia in projects of technical cooperation with african countries
i worked for an italian ngo and every project that we set up in africa failed
and i was very disturbed
i thought to the 21 that italians were good people and we were doing a good job in africa
instead everything we played <unk>
our first project which inspired my first book waves of the <unk> was a project where about italians we decided to teach people in zambia to grow food
so we came up with italian seeds in the south of zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down into the <unk> river and we teach the locals to grow italian tomatoes and beans and
of course people were not at all interested in doing that for what they paid them to come to work and sometimes they were not astonished by the local local valley they had not had agriculture
however instead of asking them how it was possible that we would not afford anything we just said thank god we are here just time to save the people in zambia of starvation
and of course everything in africa was beautifully alive
we got these magnificent tomatoes in italy a tomato would grow up to this size in zambia to this size
and we can not believe it we were saying to the <unk> look at how easy agriculture is
when the tomatoes were beautiful mature and red at night in the morning about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything and we said to the <unk> my god the <unk>
and the <unk> said yes why we do not have agriculture here why did not they say you i never asked
i thought only of us italians make mistakes in africa but then i saw what the americans did what they did what the french did and then to see what they were doing i felt quite proud of our project in zambia
because you see at least we feed the <unk>
you should see the waste should you be able to see the waste that we are going to give you to the <unk> people in africa
he wants to read a book i read dead aid from <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
the book was published in 2009
we have western donor countries we have delivered the african continent two million dollars in the last 50 years
i will not tell you about the damage that that money has caused
just read your book
it is part of an african woman the damage that we have done
the western we are the vast missionaries missionary and we treat people just in two ways or we are unaware of them or we are <unk>
the two words come from the latin root <unk> which means father
however they mean two different things
<unk> try any of a different culture as if they were my kids i want a lot
sponsor i am treating all of a different culture as if they were my servants
so white in africa are called <unk> boss
that book gave me a slap in the face the small is beautiful written by <unk> who said for all economic development if people do not want to be helped <unk> alone
this should be the first principle of aid
the first principle of aid is respect
this morning the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground and said can we imagine a city that is not <unk>
i decided at the 27 years to just respond to people and i invented a system called a enabler company where you never start anything you have never always motivates anybody but it becomes a servant of local passion the servant of the local who have the dream of becoming a better person
so what do you do
it never comes to a community with an idea and they sit with the people in the town
we do not work from the offices
we get together in a coffee we met in a bar
we have zero infrastructure
and what do we do we become friends and we found what the person wants to do
the most important thing is passion
you can give someone an idea
if that person does not want to do what you are going to do
the passion that she has for its own growth is the most important
the passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important
and then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed
the person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available
so years and years ago i had this idea why not us for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do why not for once we hear them but not in community meetings
let me tell you a secret
there is a problem with community meetings
entrepreneurial entrepreneurs and they will never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money what the opportunity have identified
so planning has this blind point
the smartest people in their community you do not even know because they do not get to their public meetings
what do we do we work on one and we work on face to face you have to create social infrastructure which does not exist
you have to create a new profession
the profession is the family doctor in the company the family family doctor who joins in their house on their kitchen table in the coffee and help him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living
i started this as a test in <unk> city of western australia
i was doing a ph.d at the time trying to get away from this patronizing crap where we got to tell you what to do
in a year i had 27 projects going on and the government came to me to ask how can you do that
how can you do it and i said i did something very very very hard
i shut up and i heard them then the government says do it again we have done it in 300 communities in the world
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness
peter <unk> one of the most great business advisers in history passed away at 96 a few years ago
peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business and this is what peter <unk> planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative business economy
planning is the kiss of death of business spirit
so now we are going to have <unk> reconstructing without knowing what the most <unk> people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy
you have to learn how to get these people to talk to you
you have to give them a lot of privacy it has to be fantastic to help them and then they will come in a mass
in a community of 10,000 people we got 200 customers
you can imagine a community of 400,000 people intelligence and passion
what do you show you have got more this morning
local people who are passionate about what you have got
so what i tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution we are at the end of the first fossil fossil <unk> fossils and of a moment to another we have systems that are not sustainable
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable
<unk> as a way to sustain machinery is not sustainable
what we have to consider is how do we cure ourselves we transport we transport to seven billion people in a sustainable form
there are no technologies to do it
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution the universities forget
the government forget
they will be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now
there is an adorable story that i read in a magazine futurist many many years ago
there was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of new york city in the year seal
and in the year removed got together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to the city of new york in 100 years and the conclusion was <unk> the city of new york would not exist within 100 years
why because they looked at the curve and they talked about if the population keeps growing up to this rate to move to the population of new york to the <unk> <unk> six million horses and dung produced by six million horses would be impossible to address
they were already <unk> in dung so in 1860 they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> new york city
so what happens in the next 40 years in 1900 in 1900 in the united states appeared <unk> companies <unk> companies
the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few factories in <unk> places
rl michigan henry ford
however there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs
first you have to offer you
otherwise they will not come to talk to you
then you have to offer them a complete dedicated <unk> service
and then later you will have to tell you the truth about it
the smallest company the biggest company has to be able to do three <unk> things the product you want to sell has to be fantastic you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell with a great financial administration
you know what
we have never met a single human being in the world that can make and look for money alone
does not exist
this is not yet born
we have looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies icons of the world carnegie thomas ford all the new google companies
there is just one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common only one percent was started by one person
never the word me but the word we are 32 times
he was not just when he started
nobody starts a company alone
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business environment sitting in coffee bars alongside their dedicated comrades who will do for you what somebody did for this gentleman who is talking about this guy somebody who is going to ask you what needs
what can you do you can do it
well you can sell you can look for money
oh no i can not do that i would like him to find someone
we activate communities
thank you
people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives
we do not know all the neighbors so we do not change a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces
over the last few years i have tried to share more with my neighbors in public space with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk
these projects came from questions like how much my neighbors pay for their apartments
how can we pay and borrowed more things without calling the door at a bad time
how do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our landscape
how do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and dreams
i live in new orleans and i am in love with new orleans
my soul always finds relief with the giant oak <unk> which gives shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and i trust a city
it always gives music to the music there is a parade in new orleans the city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties in america
i live close to this house and i thought how could it turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever
in 2009 i lost somebody who loved a lot
it was joan as a mother to me
his death was sudden and unexpected
i thought a lot about death and i thought
and this made me deep gratitude for time lived and lived
it gave him clarity to the significant things of my current life
but let us keep this look at my everyday life
it seems to me that it is easy to be able to go through the day to day and forget the really important thing for you
so with the help of old and new friends i transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant blackboard and he painted on it phrases to complete before i die i want to die
so the frequencies could take a chalk reflecting on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space
i did not know what to expect about this experiment but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
and i would like to share some things that people wrote on the wall
before i die i want to be tested by piracy before i die i want to sit on the line of a date
before i die i want to sing for millions of people
before i die i want to plant a tree
before i die i want to live outside the network
before i die i want to get it once again
before i die i want to go to the rescue of someone
before i die i want to be completely myself
this abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me and they were comfort me in difficult times
it is about knowing that you are not just trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is trying to sink on the reflection and contemplation and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and change
this happened last year and i started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community
so with my colleagues in civic center we made a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world like kazakhstan south africa australia argentina and beyond
we together showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people
in our age of distractions in increasing it is more important than ever to find the ways of keeping the perspective and remembering that life is short and delicate
death is something that we often avoid talking about or even thinking but i understood that they prepare for death is one of those things that we become more empowered
thinking about death <unk> our life
our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope to share hope and stories the people around us can not only help to improve our lives
thank you
thank you
today i have a single request
please do not tell me i am normal
now i would like to introduce you to my siblings
<unk> is 22 years old it is very handsome
it does not talk about but it is transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers
<unk> knows what love is
it shares its shares happening what happens
it is not <unk> he does not look at the color of the skin
it does not care about religious differences and notice this has never lied
when i sing songs of our childhood trying to speak to the words that i could not even remember myself remember a little bit how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown
samuel is 16 years old it is very handsome
it has the most beautiful memory
however it is a selective memory
it does not remember if i stole my <unk> but remember the year that he came out every one of the songs of my ipod conversations that we had when i was four years old to pee in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the lady gaga
it does not seem incredible
but most people do not agree
and in fact because their minds do not fit to the concept of normality in society they are often ignored and <unk>
but what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case if you would not consider them inside the ordinary that it could only mean one thing that were extraordinary autistic and extraordinary
now for those less familiar with the term autism is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication learning and sometimes physical skills
in each individual it stands in a different way of a different way from there which is so different to sam
and around the world every 20 minutes is diagnosed with a new case of autism and although it is one of the development of the development of development that is faster in the world there is no because we can not cure
i do not agree with my first encounter with autism but i do not remember one day without it
i was just three years old when my brother came to the world and i was very excited to have a new being in my life
when i was a few months ago i realized that he was different
he would yell a lot
i did not want to play like the other babies and in fact it did not seem very interested in me at all
<unk> lived and he was in his own world with their own rules and i was pleasure in the smallest things like putting the cars in row around the room and look at the washing machine and eat anything that would have between half
as i grew up it became more different and the differences were made more obvious
but beyond hippocrates of frustration and the endless hyperactivity there was something really unique a pure and innocent nature a child who looked at the world without prejudice and a human being had never lied
extraordinary
i can not deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family moments when i wish they were just like me
but i look back to the things that have taught me about individuality communication and love and i realize that they are things that would not want to change for normal
normal it is about the beauty that give us the differences and the fact that they are different does not mean that some of it is wrong
it only means that there is a different vision of what is right
if i could reach one thing to <unk> and sam and you do not have to be normal
they can be extraordinary
because autistic or not the differences we have are a gift each of us has a gift inside and honestly the search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential
the opportunity for greatness progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others
please do not tell me i am normal
thank you
five years ago i experienced a little bit what it must have been summarized in the country of wonders
penn state asked me a communications teacher to give up a class of communication to engineering students
i was scared scared of truth to be afraid of these students with their great minds their great books and their great unknown words
but by developing those conversations i felt what alicia must have felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world
just so i felt when i had those conversations with the students it surprised me the ideas that they had and i wanted others to experience this wonderful world
and i think the key to opening that door is a great communication
we desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world
our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care among others and if we do not know we do not know what the work is not done and i think it is our responsibility as not as scientists have these interactions
but these big conversations can not happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world
so scientists and engineers please engage with <unk>
i want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive
first question for <unk> and then what
<unk> why is science relevant to us
do not tell us they just study <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it is important to understand and treat osteoporosis
and when you are describing their science care with the jargon
the jargon is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas
sure you can say space and temporary but why not say space and time that is much more accessible to us
making them accessible is not the same thing to make silly
instead as einstein said that everything is as simple as possible but not simple
they can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas
something to consider is to use examples stories and analogies are ways of outraged and <unk> with their content
and by presenting his job forget the bullet signs
you have wondered why they are called bullets what the bullets do the bullets kill and kill their presentation
a <unk> like this is not only boring but it is supported too much in the area of the language of our brain and it leads to us
instead this <unk> of example from <unk> brown is much more effective it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower
the trick here is to use a simple legible sentence that the public can understand if it is lost a little and then providing graphs that we are going to provide our other senses and believe a deeper sense of understanding what it is described
i think these are just some key ones that can help each other open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering
and so scientists and engineers when you have solved this equation for all the media you are going to talk to <unk> thank you
one of my favorite words of all the oxford english dictionary is <unk>
just because it sounds very good
and <unk> means dishonest politician
but there was a contemporary editor of the 19th century which defined it so much better when he said a <unk> is the one that is looking for a public charge no matter of <unk> or principle and when you win it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
i have no idea what it means <unk>
something to do with words i guess
it is very important that words are the basis in politics and that all politicians know they have to try to master language
it was not until for example that the british parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the parliamentary camera
and all this was because of the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the parliament
they got in the tower in london and imprisoned him but he had enough enough of dealing with them and at the end he had such popular support in london
and only a few years later we had the first use of recorded the phrase so <unk> as well as the metal
most people think it is literal
it is not for a freedom advocate of expression
but to show you really how words and politics interact i want you to go back to the you.s just after independence
so they had to address the question of how to call george washington his leader
they did not know
how do you call the leader of a republican country
this was discussed in congress for a long time
they were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
some of them wanted to call him head of state washington and others his <unk> george washington and other advocate of the liberties of the united states
not very attractive
some they just wanted to call it king
they thought it was <unk>
and not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen king for a given term
and i could have served
everybody got tired of all the world got tired because this debate will be taken out for three weeks
i read the diary of a senator senator and i always write this topic
what caused the delay and the <unk> was that the house of representatives was against the senate
the house of representatives did not want washington to be empowered
they did not want to call him king if i was giving him or his successor to him
so they wanted to give the title more modest most unfortunate and more unfortunate than they were
and that title was president
president did not invent the title existed before but it only meant somebody who is going to be a meeting
it was like the president of a jury
and i did not have much more <unk> than the term foreman or <unk>
there were <unk> small <unk> <unk> and fractions of government but it was really a insignificant title
and that is why the senate got together
they said it is ridiculous we can not call the president
this guy has to sign treaties and come together with foreigners
and who will be serious with a title as ridiculous and insignificant as president of america
and finally after three weeks of debate the senate did not give up
we can learn three interesting things about this
first of all and this is my favorite to where i have been able to figure out the senate has never been aware of the title of president
president barack obama is lucky to keep there waiting for the senate between action
the second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary it is possible that we are going to keep waiting for <unk> years
but the third thing that we can learn and this is the most important thing and with this i want to leave you is that the president of america does not sound as modest today
especially if you get more than 5,000 nuclear heads available to the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air aerial vehicles and so on
reality and history have endowed the title of <unk>
so at the end i won the senate
they got their title <unk>
and also the other concern about the senate the appearance of uniqueness well it was a uniqueness
but you know how many nations have now president
and all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads etc
so at the end the senate won and the house of representatives lost because no one is going to be humble when you say they are now the president of the united states
and i think that is the great lesson that we can learn and that i would like to leave you with
politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality but actually reality changed much more words than what these might change reality
thank you very much
i am 45 to feet underground in an illegal mine of ghana
the air is loaded with heat and dust and it is hard to breathe
i feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark but i can not see much more
i hear voices that talk about but mostly that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive tools
as the other i have been wearing a cheap light flashlight <unk> strapped through this elastic elastic elastic rubber and i can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that little subway hole that drops hundreds of meters on earth
i am going to get my hand out and all of a sudden i remember a miner that i met days before he lost the control and dropped countless feet in that well
while i am talking with you today these men are in the depths of that hole at risk your lives without pay and often dying
i went out of that hole and i went home but they may never do it because they are prey of slavery
over the last 28 years i have been documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and in 2009 i had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the middle of vancouver peace
among all the amazing people i met there i met a free <unk> for the <unk> an ngo who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery
we started talking about slavery and i really began to learn about slavery because i knew that there was in the world but not to such a degree
when we finished talking i felt very bad i was embarrassed to ignore this atrocity of our days and i thought if i do not know how many people do not know
he made me a knot the stomach and weeks later i flew to los angeles to meet the director of free the <unk> and offer my help
so i started my journey to modern slavery
interestingly it had been in many of these sites
some of them even considered them my second home
but this time <unk> dirty cheese
a conservative calculation says there are currently more than 27 million people in the world
it is twice as much of the number of africans displaced during the entire <unk> slaves
150 years ago the cost of a slave farmer was three times the annual salary of a you.s worker
the equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today
however today you can enslave entire families for generations per hour per capita debt
amazingly slavery generates more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world
many of them have been fooled by false education promises and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without paying low threat violence and they can not escape
today slavery operates in trade goods produced by slaves they have value but those who produce they are disposable
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it is illegal throughout the world
in india and nepal i met the bricks of bricks
this strange and formidable spectacle was like entering the ancient egypt or hell of birth
they embedded in a temperature of 54 degrees c men in fact women in fact entire families wrapped up in a heavy overcoat of <unk> <unk> using their heads up to 18 to the same time and they carry them from hot furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of meters
he tore out by monotony and tiredness works in silence doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day
there were no time to eat or drinking and <unk> <unk> i would make it pee out pretty much
so <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and i stopped working
every 20 minutes i had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning and <unk> and sitting there thinking my camera gets a much better treatment that these people are
back on the furnaces i wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and he said lisa do not do it you do not do it
and he explained very clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this not just for me but for them
i could not offer you any direct help
i could not give you money nothing
i was not citizen in that country
i could put them in a situation worse than they were already
i had to trust the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and he trusted it
in terms of i waited to get home to feel my heart
in the himalayas i found kids carrying rocks for miles on a mountain land to trucks that were waiting at the bottom
those big big ones were more heavy than the kids who charge them and the kids hold them to their heads with straps and made out of clubs and strings and rags
it is hard to see something so overwhelming
how can we influence something as insidious but ubiquitous
some do not even know that they are slaves and they work 16 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been like this whole life
they have nothing to compare
when these villagers <unk> their freedom the <unk> burned all their houses
when you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking and because of this global consciousness they warned me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business
in kathmandu i was <unk> women who had been previously previously heard
it led me for a few <unk> stairs which gave this dirty basement of dim light light
it was not exactly a brothel
it was rather a restaurant
car restaurant is known in the craft they are local for forced prostitution
they have rooms small private rooms where the slaves were doing with their girls and children some of that only seven years are forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol
each put it is dark and dirty identified by a small number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain
the workers often suffer sexual abuse by hands of their clients
standing on saturday i remember having a sense a fear acute burning and in that instant i could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell
i just had one exit the stairs where i came in
there was no doors
there were no windows big enough to climb
those people do not have <unk> and because we touch a topic that is very difficult to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking is happening around us
there are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture in domestic service and the list can continue to continue
recently the new york times reported that between 100,000 american children are sold every year as sexual slaves
it happens everywhere but we do not see it
textiles is another activity that often associate with slave labor
i went to indian villages in which there were entire families <unk> in silk trade
this is a family portrait
the <unk> hands of black are the father <unk> blue and red
they mix up <unk> in these big barrels and they dip the silk in the liquid to our elbows but the data is toxic
my performer told me their stories
we do not have freedom they said
we still hope yet to be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our work
it is estimated that there are over 4,000 children enslaved in the lake carcass the greatest artificial lake in the world
when we came up i went to take a quick look
i saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family on a ship two older brothers some younger children make sense not
error were everyone slaves
children are separated from their families sold missing and forced to work locally on these boats in the lake despite not knowing swimming
this child is eight years old
when our boat came up i was shaking i was shaking the subject that his little canoe was <unk>
i was paralyzed by the fear of falling to the water
the branches of the trees in northern lake equals often <unk> networks and children and fear they are thrown into the water to unlock the branches
many they drown
since it is always been forced to work in the lake
for fear of his love it is not going to flee and like all life has been treaty cruelty to <unk> the youngest slaves under their command
i met these guys at five in the morning when he released the last networks but they had been working from one one
in the cold and <unk> night
and it fits that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are packed with fish
i want to introduce you to kofi
kofi was rescued in a fishermen village
i met him in a shelter where the free <unk> <unk> victims of slavery
kofi symbolizes that possible
who is going to be thank you that someone decided to make a difference in your life
driving by a road in ghana with the <unk> of the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window
he asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle
at the end of the way we were going to get out of the car and asked the driver to go out quickly
then you signal this path barely visible and he said this is the way this is the way we go
as we started down we took the <unk> off the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent rains so i put the pictures of photos on my head as we were coming down in these waters to the chest
after two hours of walking the <unk> path ended up abruptly and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football field and they were all filled with workers enslaved
a lot of women had children tied on their back and as they were looking for gold they walked into poison water with mercury
the mercury is used in the process of extraction
these miners are enslaved in a well in another part of ghana
when they came out of the pump they were in their own sweat
i remember looking at his eyes tired <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours
the pits have up to 90 feet and these people have got heavy stone bags that will then be transported down to another area in which we were able to extract the stone to be able to extract the gold
in the first view the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see working on other lucky ones and children too
they are all victims of injury disease and violence
in fact it is very likely that this trait will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and poisoning poisoning a few years
this is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in mines
when he died his uncle <unk> i get this uncle debt which is force to be slave in mines
when i met him i had worked on the 14-year old mines and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine so severe that doctors said i should be
in addition to that <unk> has tuberculosis and yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine
yet he dream to be liberated and educated with the help of local activists as the <unk> and it is this kind of determination of face to a remote possibility which inspires me a lot of respect
i want to throw a light on slavery
they knew that their images would be seen by you around the world
i wanted you to know that we will give you a testament to them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives
honestly i think if we can see each other as human beings then it is very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery
these images are not from magazines are people real people like you and like me who deserve the same rights and and respect in their lives
there is no day that happens i do not think of these many people beautiful battered that i have had the great honor to meet
i hope that these images wake up a force that you see in people like you and i hope that that force turn on fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because without that light the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows
thank you very much
i do applied math and there is a peculiar problem for whom we are like business consultants
nobody knows what the hell we do
so today i will try and try to explain to you what i do
dance is one of the most human activities
we <unk> the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> that we will see later on
but the demand demand a degree of training a high level of skill and probably certain initial fitness that well can have a genetic component
sadly neurological disorders like parkinson's disease destroy gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who in his time was a virtuous dancer dancer
over the last few years has made a lot of progress in treatment
but there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick and they have to deal with an incurable weakness stiffness and other symptoms of this disease so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late
we need to be able to measure progress in objective ways and ultimately the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
but it is frustrating with parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers so they do not serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes
you have to go to a clinic to do it it is very very expensive and that means that the clinical trials are never done
and what if patients could do it at home
that would save a trip to the clinic what if patients could do the test themselves
you would not need a staff
by the way it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic
so what i want to think about as a conventional way to try and try and see in some sense at least we are all virtuous and my friend <unk> <unk>
this is a video of the vocal cords vibration
it shows someone healthy as it emits sounds by speaking we can imagine as a female ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes for example for example
and as the ballet has an extraordinary training level of training
let us think about time that takes a child to learn to speak
from sound we can track the position of vocal cords as they vibrate and as parkinson's is affecting the limbs it will also affect the vocal organs
on the bottom trace you can see an example of irregular string of vocal cords
we see the same symptoms
shake vocal weakness and stiffness
the speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while and this is an example of symptoms
how do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials well they are both invasive
the neurological test is not invasive they both use existing infrastructure
it is not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to make them
they are both accurate well but also exams based on voice are not specialized
i mean they can be <unk>
they are very rapidly getting about 30 seconds like a lot
they are low cost and we all know what happens
when something will increase a cost so low of a massive scale
these are some amazing goals ready to address
we can reduce the hard difficulties of patients
i would not need to go to the clinic to keep them routine
with high frequency monitoring we could get data goals
we could do low cost mass trials for clinical trials and for the first time they are going to get available to a general scale
we have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomarkers of the disease before it is too late
so when i am going to give you today the first steps in that sense we are launching the vocal initiative of parkinson's
next to <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets
we have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world
anyone with or non parkinson's you can call at the price of the price and let me look at a few cents and i am pleased to announce that we have reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours
thank you tom rielly so max taking all these samples of say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who does not
what will you take from these samples
max little yeah what is happening is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease tr of course
<unk> you see some people can not pass on it can not get it
but we are going to get a very large sample of data <unk> in different circumstances and do it in different circumstances it is important because we are looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of disease
tr they have 86 percent precision right now
they are going to get much more than that
actually my student <unk> i have got to have a fantastic job and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network also what we are doing the project now we have 99 percent accuracy
tr nine and nine well it is an improvement
<unk> of course
tr thank you very much max little public
<unk> thank you tom
before march 2011 i was doing <unk> <unk> in new york city
we are creatures <unk> gray creatures
we hide in the dark in quarters without windows and usually we avoid sunlight
we make the perfectly thinner models of the perfect skin even more perfect skin even more perfect we do the impossible and to criticize us in the press all the time but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography
on march 11 of 2011 i saw from my house as the rest of the world the tragic events that happen in japan
soon time later an organization where was voluntary there <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team
i with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we could not stay sitting at home so i decided to join the group for three weeks
13 percent of may travel to <unk>
it is a small <unk> village located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people one of the first people who are affected by the wave
the water level recorded more than 24 feet tall and over three miles earth
as you can imagine the village was devastated
we got rubble from the canals and the ditches
we cleaned up schools we take the mud and we leave the houses and it is ready to be turkish and <unk>
we take tons of tons of dead fish rotten <unk> <unk>
we <unk> and loved it
for weeks both the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things
they found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and cards
they all did the same thing
they get them and bring them to different places in the villages around them to get it
it was not until i realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered
as he was fleeing the wave and to save their lives they had to abandon everything they had
at the end of my first week i started to help in a center in the village
it helped clean mass toilets huge giant <unk>
this place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of cooking would pick the pictures
there were them and i had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean by hand
this was exciting and inspiring i had heard the expression of thinking beyond the horizons but it was not until i go beyond myself my horizons something happened
when you look at the pictures i found some that had more than a hundred years old they were still in the lab in the lab i could not help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing
so that night i went into facebook contacted with some of them and the next morning the answer was so overwhelmingly and positive that i knew we had to try
so we started to tinker with the photos
this was the first of all
it was not too paranoid but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl i had to get to make a lot of precision and yet
in another way that little girl would not look like it and that would be as tragic as i have the spoiled picture
at the time time they arrived for the most of the time they got more pictures and they took more <unk> so i went back on facebook and linkedin and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help
after two weeks i had 150 people who were <unk>
in japan in july we would mobilize ourselves a neighboring village to northern <unk>
once a week we were using our scanner in the temporal photography libraries that were installed where people were going to reclaim their photos
the time that we took in <unk> is a different story it depended on of course from the photos of the photos
it could mean an hour it could mean a few weeks
it could mean months
this <unk> had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and the color and the water was not destroyed
it took a long time
the water destroyed all of these pictures submerged in salt water covered in bacteria with algae with algae and it is all about it along with the step of time i continue to go through it it was an important part of the project
we could not be able to perform the picture unless it was clean dry and it would have been wiped out for its owner
we got lucky with your hands
we tell the guide to a remarkable neighbor
it is very easy to harm even more the photos already damaged
as he said i once said the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo
you can not make mistakes
the woman who brought us these pictures he was lucky in relation to photos
he had started <unk> herself but he stopped realizing that the injured even more
i also had <unk>
without them the images of her husband and their own face would not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and perform the whole picture
when i picked up his pictures shared something about his story with us
a few colleagues in his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far from where they used to be their house but their colleagues recognized it
the tsunami day her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave
he had to go inside the water while the sirens would sound
their kids little not so small now but their two children were in school in different schools
one of them was caught in the water
it took a week to find his entire family and know that they had all survived
the day i gave him his photos his youngest son was 14
for her despite all these pictures were the best gift i could do something that he could do something that i could remember from the past which would not have been beaten by that day march when everything in his life changed or destroyed
after six months in japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us there were hundreds of them they helped us to clean up to hand from 250,000 photographs the vast majority of majority became the hands of their major owners
more than 500 volunteers all around the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
during this time we do not really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials most of the ink for printers
we took pictures constantly
a picture is a memory of someone or something a relationship someone loved
they are <unk> from our memories and stories the last thing we would take but the first thing we would return to look for
this was the project to restore little bits of humanity to bring someone their connection to the past
when a picture like this is give someone a huge difference in the life of the person who gets it
this project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
some of them connected them with something bigger to return to something that is going to give you a talent to something that are not thin skin models
to finish i would like to read this email i sent him cindy that day i came back from japan after six months
while <unk> could not stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images
one in particular a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl gathering around a baby i was moved by because a similar picture of my family my mother my mother and my newly born daughter hangs out of our wall
in the entire world in all of our basic needs are the same right
thank you
doc <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that is going through an apple in an exhibition of only one millionth of a second
but now 50 years later we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second
i present to you a new type of photography the <unk> a new technique that can make videos in slow motion of light in motion
and with that we can create cameras that can see after the corners of the line of vision or see the inside of the body without using x rays and defy the idea of camera
if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and turn it off in a second or it is in a number of <unk> to create a pack of photons just a millimeter
and that set of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light and again a million times faster than a common bullet
if we took that bullet and this set of photons and we shoot in this bottle how they disperse those photons into this bottle
what is the aspect of light in slow motion
now all of this remember that all of this is actually in less than a <unk> it is what it takes to travel to the light
but this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion
coca cola does not take this research happen so many things in this film we are going to show this information to show what is going on
the pulse of our bullet goes into the bottle with a pack of photons and it starts to go through and then it starts to <unk>
part of the light goes off it goes to the table and we started looking at these ripples
many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions
as you can see there is a bubble of air bouncing inside
in that time the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts of the top you see at the bottom of the bottle after several frames that the thoughts are concentrated
now if we take a single regular bullet and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times how much they think it would take us sitting on to see that movie
one day a week actually a week
it would be a very boring film of a slow bullet movement
and what about being tested with dead nature
and you can see the waves that are <unk> from the tomato table and the back wall
it is like throwing a stone on a pond
it is the way nature looks like a picture i thought about a <unk> at the time but of course our eyes see an integral composition
but if you look at once again this tomato will realize that as light takes over the tomato are still bright it is not dark
why because tomato are mature and light bounces inside it and it goes back after several <unk> second
in the future when this <unk> is in your mobile phones they are going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it
so what do we create this camera at mit
like photographers you know if you take a picture at a low exhibition comes in very little light
but we are going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exposure so i can barely get into some light
we sent that bullet that package of photons millions of times and we recorded over and over and again with very cleverly we take those gigabytes of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> i showed you
we can take all those raw data and <unk> in a interesting way
superman can fly
other heroes can become invisible
and if a new power of a future superhero would allow you to see after the corners
the idea is that we could throw some light on the door to go into the room one part is going to reflect on the door and from there to the camera
where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
it is not science fiction we have already built
on the left is our <unk>
behind the wall there is a rosebush and <unk> the light on the door
after the publication of our article in nature communications
and a tiny fraction of photons will go back into the camera but interestingly at slightly different moments
and as we have a camera that works so fast our <unk> has unique capabilities
it is very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light
so we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we do not know what dot corresponds to how far
by projecting a laser you can record a raw picture you see on the screen it does not really make any sense
but we will take a lot of images that are tens of images we are going to take them up and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> light and that is what we can see the hidden object
can we see it in 3d
this is our reconstruction
we have got things to explore before we get this in the lab but in the future we could create cars that will avoid collisions with what is going around the curve
or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected by open windows
or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body having <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
but of course because of the tissue and the blood this is quite difficult so this is actually a order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization mode to solve the problems of imaging in the next generation
so as doc <unk> himself a scientist turned science in art an art of photographs of photographs
i realized that all of the gigabytes of data that we collect every time is not just for scientific views but we can
creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and code code
and look at those waves remember the time between each of those waves it is just a second <unk>
but here it also happens something fun
if you look at the waves underneath the cap these are going on from us
the waves should be moving towards us
what happens here
it turns out that we are recording almost at the speed of light we have got some strange effects of einstein i would have loved to see this image
the order in which events are happening in the world sometimes has been invested in the camera
applying the corresponding warping of space and time we can correct this distortion
it is time thank you
hi this is my mobile phone
a mobile phone can change life and gives you individual freedom
with a cell phone you can <unk> a crime against humanity in syria
with a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt
with a cell phone you can record a song that is called <unk> and get famous
this is all possible with a mobile phone
i am a <unk> of 1984 and i live in the city of berlin
let us go back to that moment to this city
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting for a change
this is the fall in 1989 imagine if all of these people gathered in search of a change they had a mobile phone in your pocket
who in the middle have a mobile phone here
<unk>
raise your mobile phones
do a android a blackberry wow
it is a lot almost everyone today has a mobile phone
but today i am going to talk about my phone and how i changed life
i will talk about this
these are 35 <unk> of information lines
raw data
why is that information there
because in the summer of 2006 the e.you commission filed a board
this is a data retention directive
this directive says that every european phone company every single internet supplier from all europe has to store a broad range of information from users
who is called who who sends an email to who who sends an email
who sends a text to whom
and if we use the mobile phone where we are
all of this information is stored at least six months and until two years in your phone company or your internet provider
and all over europe people got planted and said we do not want this
they said they did not want this consumer retention
we want self determination in the digital age and we do not want the phone and the internet providers stored all of this information about us
there were lawyers journalists priests everybody said we do not want this
and here you can see about 10 thousand people who went to the streets in berlin and they said freedom not fear
and some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0
<unk> was the secret police in germany
and i also asked myself if this works really
they can store all this information about us
every time i use the mobile
so i asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in germany that please me <unk> all the information that they had about me
i asked them once and i went back and i did not get a concrete response it was all blah blah
but then i said i want to have this information because you are <unk> my life
so i decided to get a lawsuit for justice because i wanted to have this information
but <unk> <unk> said no we will not give you this information
in the end we signed an agreement
they took the demand and they sent me the information that i would ask
meanwhile the german constitutional tribunal failed the <unk> for the german law of the e.you
so i got this ugly over brown with a cd inside
and in the cd there was this
thirty five and five thousand <unk> of information
at first i saw them and i said well it is a huge archive right
but after a while i realized that it is my life
there are six months of my life in this archive
it was a bit skeptical what had to do with that
because you can see where i am at night what am i doing
but then i said i want this information to come out
i want to make it public
because i want to show people what the retention of data means
so next to <unk> online and open data city we did this
this is a six month visualization of my life
you can zoom in and move away go back and forwards
you can see every step i give
and you can see how i am going from <unk> in a colony and what i am often calling on the journey
this is all possible with this information
that gives a little fear
but it is not just me
but all of us
first there are things like i call my wife and she calls me talk a couple of times
and then they call me some friends and they are called each other
and then you call each other and the other and we ended up with this big network of communications
you can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other to what time they sleep
you can see all this
you can see the centers the leaders of the group
if you have access to this information you can see what society is doing
if you have access to this information you can control your society
this is a model for countries like china and iran
so this is a model to study the shape of your society because you know who talks to who who says to who you are email who all this is possible if you have access to this information
and this information is stored at least six months in europe and until two years
as i said at first imagine if all these people in the streets in berlin in the fall in 1989 they had a mobile phone in your pocket
and the <unk> had known who participated in this protest and if the <unk> had known who leaders were this never happened
the fall of the berlin wall may never have happened
and as a result either of the iron curtain either
because today state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web
they want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to store them forever
but self determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction
but today you have to fight for self determination
you have to fight for that every day
when they go home tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and that is not last fashion
when you go home tell her representative that just because businesses and state agencies can store some information they do not have to do it
and if you do not believe me ask your phone company what information you store from you
so in the future every time you use your mobile phones that will help you remember they have to fight for self determination in the digital era
thank you
hi tedwomen what happens
it is not enough
hi tedwomen what happens
i call myself <unk> <unk> and i am not <unk> but i know the doctor that brought me to the world
i cut my mom six times in six different directions <unk> to the poor of me in the process
as a result i have cerebral palsy that is why we will spend all the time
watch
it is exhausting i am like a mixture of <unk>
and muhammad
the p. c is not genetic
it is not <unk> and it can contract
no one <unk> the uterus of my mother and i did not get it because my parents were cousins brothers even though they are
it is just about accidents like that i was born at birth
now i warn you i am not a source of inspiration and i do not want any of the present
i feel bad for me because at some time of life they have wanted to be disabled
let us go
christmas eve are in the mall drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see
16 places empty places
and they think god can i be at least a little bit disabled
and i am saying i have 99 problems and the p. c is just one of them
there is a <unk> of oppression i would win the gold medal
i am muslim palestinian woman and alive in new jersey
if you do not feel better maybe they should do it
i am from <unk> park in new jersey
i always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same early
i also love that if i wanted to walk from my home to new york i could
a lot of people with cerebral palsy do not walk but my parents do not believe you can not
the mantra of my father was you can do it dance dancing
if my three older sisters were wiped out
if my three older sisters were going to school in public school my parents would take their parents to the school system and they were glad that i would also be and if we did not take all the maximum note we all took the <unk> of my mother
my father taught me to walk at the age of five to put my toes on her feet and just walking
another tactic that i used was just hang on a dollar in front of me so that you would get it
the <unk> that i wear in it was very strong and so
yes the first day in kindergarten i was walking as a boxing champion that has received many strokes
growing there was only six arabs in my city and they were all of the family
now there are 20 arabs and still every family i think nobody realized we were not italian
this was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use hatred of muslims as motto campaign
the people that i grew up with no problems with my faith
nevertheless it seemed like it was a lot of starvation that died during the ramadan time
i would tell you that i had enough fat to live three months old without eating so far from dawn at sunset it is very easy
i danced on broadway
yes on broadway it is crazy my parents could not afford the physical therapy so i sent to the dance school
i learned to dance with a hotel or whatever i can walk with a heels
i am from new jersey and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing heels i am also
and when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the jersey coast i was not going to go
i spent my summers in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if not let us go back to palestine all the summers were <unk> in madonna
on summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so i would drink milk in the deer put me hot cups on the back i am going down in the dead sea and i remember the water burning my eyes and i thought it works
but the miracle cure was the yoga
i have to say it is very boring but before i do yoga it was a <unk> up comedian and i could not stand up <unk> <unk>
and now i can stand on the head
my parents <unk> this idea that i could do anything that no dream was impossible and my dream was to be in the upper hospital
i went to college through positive discrimination and i got a scholarship for the <unk> university of the state of arizona because it was in all the <unk>
it was like the <unk> pet in the theater department
everybody loved me
i did all the least smart tasks i took the ultimate note in my classes and also in their classes
every time i did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers would breathe
but i never got a paper
finally in my last year the <unk> decided to make a piece called a very slow dance in jackson
it is a piece of a girl with cerebral palsy
i was a girl with cerebral palsy
so i started screaming at the four winds in order to have a role
i have cerebral palsy
finally free free
thank god almighty i am free
i did not get the paper they gave him brown
i went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying historically as if someone had killed my cat to ask why and she told me that because they believed i could not make the risk stunts
and i said excuse me if i can not do the risk stunts neither can the character
it was a paper that was literally born and they gave an actress without cerebral palsy
university was imitating my life
hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disabilities for disabled
when i graduated home and my first <unk> <unk> was like extra in a soap
my dream was actually made
and i knew it would be <unk> from me to better friend crazy in a <unk>
instead i stayed there like a vase i did not see myself more than the back and it was clear to me that <unk> directors do not <unk> actors not white <unk>
it is just going to take them to perfect people
but there were exceptions to the rule
i grew up looking at <unk> goldberg waved <unk> ellen and all of these women had one thing in common they were comedians
so i made it <unk>
on my first tour i took new york of new york to new jersey to new jersey and i will never forget the head of the first comedian that took when he fell to high speed on the highway of new jersey with a driver that had cerebral palsy
i worked in clubs across the united states and also in arabic in the middle east without censorship
some people say i am the first <unk> in the arab world
i never like to reclaim the first place but i know you have never heard that little nasty rumor that says women are not fun and they are really fun
in 2003 my brother of another mother and father dean <unk> and i launched the <unk> comedy festival of new york now in his 10 year
our goal was to change the negative image of american americans in the media and to remind the directors of <unk> <unk> and arabic <unk> are not <unk>
integrating arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma stigma
my great opportunity came in 2010
i was like invited to the news program on wire behind with keith <unk>
i walked into a graduation dance dragged me back to a studio and they sat me on a wheelchair
i looked at the principal and i said excuse me sorry i can give you another chair
she looked at me and she said five four three two
and we were alive
so i hit the speaker desk so i will not get out of the screen during the segment and when i finished the interview i was pale
i finally had my opportunity and <unk> i knew they would not get me
but not only mr <unk> came back to me but i was like running the full time <unk> and pasted my chair
something fun i learned in direct with keith <unk> was that the people on the internet are scum
it is said that kids are cruel but they never made fun of me or a little bit more
suddenly my disability on the internet became <unk> object
i saw clips online with comments like why <unk>
it is <unk>
and my favorite poor <unk> terrorist
what disease has it
we should really pray for it
a commentator one suggested i would even add my disability to my rsum writer paralyzed
disability is as visual as race
if someone in a wheelchair can not make <unk> then <unk> can not make someone in a wheelchair
the disabled are yes clapping man go
the disabled is the largest minority of the world and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment
doctors said no walk but i am here in front of you
however i have grown up with the media i do not think it was
i hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life
maybe if there would be more positive images that would take less hatred on the internet
or maybe not
maybe we still need all the society to teach our children well
my tortuous journey has led me to very spectacular places
i came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
i got to act on a film with adam <unk> and working with my role the incredible dave matthews
i went to the world performing arabs have become crazy
i was <unk> in representation of the great jersey of new jersey in <unk> 2008
and i founded the children of <unk> a charity to give the palestinian refugees a little bit of what my parents gave me
it was the only time my father saw me live and i am doing this talk to her memory
you lie in peace
i call myself <unk> <unk> and if i can you can too
i would like to tell you a story about a child of a small village
i do not know your name but i know your story
he lives in a little town south of <unk>
this village is near <unk>
drought drives the small people to poverty and to the brink of starvation
nothing for him there is going to the great city in this case <unk> the capital of somalia
when you get there there is no opportunity there is no job or perspectives of future
he just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
after maybe a year <unk> nothing
one day he gets about a guy who offers him to lunch then for dinner for lunch
he knows a bunch of people who give a break
it gets a little bit of money for you to buy new money to get home to their family
they presented to a young man
finally home
it starts a new life
it has a goal of life
a beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb
that little boy from that little village with the dreams of the great city was the suicide bomber and that dynamic group of people were al <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al qaeda
so how did the story of a little boy from a little village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
he was waiting
i was waiting for an opportunity to start his future waiting for a future perspective and this was the first thing that came to him
this was the first thing he pulled it out of what we call the waiting period
and his story is repeated in urban centers around the world
it is the story of the urban young urban youth who <unk> riots in johannesburg <unk> riots in london who are looking for something beyond the waiting period
for the young people the promise of the city the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity for well being but young people do not participate in the prosperity of their cities
it is often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment
by 2030 three of every five people living in cities are less than 18 years old
if you do not include young people in the growth of our cities if we do not provide opportunities the history of the waiting period the door of access to the violence to gang violence to be the history of cities 2.0
and in my hometown of birth <unk> 70 percent of the young people are unemployed
70 does not work it is not going to school
they do not quite do anything
i went back to <unk> last month and i went to visit the hospital <unk> hospital where i was born
i remember being in front of that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking and if i would never been gone
and if i had been forced to be in that same period of waiting
i would have become terrorist
i am not really sure about the answer
the reason i was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders in a business summit
i met about 90 leaders somali somali
we sat down and we had an rain of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city
one of the young people in the room was <unk>
he went to the university of <unk> he graduated
there was no job no opportunities
i remember when he told me that because he was a graduate college graduate unemployed who was the perfect white for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations to be recruited
they were looking for people like him
but this story takes a different way
in <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point to b is the streets
23 years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize
<unk> saw an opportunity and i rose
it started a motorcycle company
it started <unk> to local residents who normally could not get them
i bought 10 bikes with the help of his family and friends and her dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years
why is this different story
what does this story do different
i think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity
it is the spirit business and i think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the waiting period
let us engage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs
i want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my mohamed meetings <unk> a florist
i was helping to train some of the young people at the top of the business initiative and how to create a culture of business initiative
in fact it is the first florist that <unk> has seen in over 22 years and until mohamed came to me if you wanted flowers for your wedding wedding we were free from overseas
if you give somebody when it was the last time you saw fresh flowers
for those who grew up during the civil war the answer would be never
so mohamed saw a chance
it started a <unk> and floral design
he created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow up and <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
and it started the delivery of flowers for weddings creating gardens in the houses and the city companies and now it is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years
there are no public parks in <unk>
he wants to create a space where young families can go together and like he says smell the roses <unk>
by the way he does not smile because they use a lot of water
so the first step is to inspire young people and in that room ali presence had a really profound impact on young people
they had never thought about starting a business
they had thought about working for an ngo working for government but their story their innovation really had a strong impact on them
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity
i encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs who might be able to be able to change the change
for the end of the day they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city
they have been able to have business business for local problems
so inspire young people and create a corporate spirit culture it is really a big step but young people need capital to do their ideas
they need experience and orientation to guide them in development and put on their business
they connect to young people with the resources that they need <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation and create <unk> for urban growth
for me the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business
it is to create social impact
mohamed is not just selling flowers
i think it is selling hope
her peace park that is how it is called when it is created transform the way people see their city
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him
they gave them a chance to escape from the paralysis of the waiting period
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities
so my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs <unk> and eating their inherent innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and parks of peace than cars bomb and periods
thank you
i was about 10 years old and i went camping with my dad in the mountains <unk> an area <unk> north of the state of new york
it was a beautiful day
the <unk> forest
the sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it is not going to be on the way that we were still almost to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land
we got to our camp
it was a she would in a <unk> with a beautiful skull lake when i discovered something horrible
behind the she would there was a dump of about four square feet with apple apple balls <unk> aluminum <unk> and old shoe
and i was amazed i was very angry and incredibly confused
the <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought i was going to clean their trash
that question went on with me and a little bit slightly simplified
who cleans our trash
no matter how to organize it or where put our trash back into istanbul
who cleans our garbage in rio or in paris or in london
here in new york city department clean our garbage at the reason of 11 tons of waste and two billion tons of recyclable products every day
i wanted to know them as individuals
i wanted to understand who that work does
what does it feel like to use the uniform and take that load
so i started a research project with them
i traveled in the trucks and i walked around and i interviewed people in offices and installations in the city and i learned a lot but it was still a <unk>
i needed to go into more
so i started working like <unk>
now i am not just traveling in the trucks i drove them up
and it operated the mechanical <unk> and roll the snow
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning
they all ask about the smell
it is there but it is not as prevalent as you believe and in the days that it is very strong you get used very quickly
it costs a lot to get used to weight
i met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies followed by eating their body tons of garbage all the weeks
it is also the danger
according to the job statistics for labor collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country and i learned the reason
you are coming out and entering traffic all the day and they are <unk> around you
they just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention
that is very bad for the worker
and also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and because terrible damage
i also learned about the relentless of the crap
when you come out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself
it never stops coming
it is also like a form of breathing or circulation
it is always going to be in motion
and it is also stigma
it seems that stigma is especially ironic because i think strongly that the hunter hunter are the most important work in the streets of the city for three reasons
they are the first protective public health
if you do not get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective way every day this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent they threaten us in very real ways
diseases that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and begin to <unk>
the economy needs them
if we can not get rid of the old we do not have space for the new things that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it is in danger consumption
i am not advocating for capitalism i just pointed out your relationship
and then there is what i call our average speed every day
i mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time
we usually do not care about we do not care about we cleaned or we cleaned up or we have got our coffee cup our bag of <unk> our water bottle
we use them we <unk> it we forget about them because we know there is a force force on the other side that we would take out of it
so today i want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe help to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city
his work i think is almost <unk>
they are in the street every day in the street
they use a uniform in many cities
you know when you are going to go
and their work allows us to do our own
they are almost a form of relief
the flow that keeps us safe from ourselves from ourselves of our own waste our waste and that flow always has to stay in a way or another
one day after 11 of september 2001 i heard the lord of a pile of waste collection truck i grabbed my little son and i went down the stairs running and there was a man doing his way from the recycled paper as i did every wednesday
and i tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day but i started crying
and he looked at me and he just nodded and said we are going to be okay
we are going to be okay
shortly after that i started looking at the waste collection and i went back to that man
it is called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends
i want to believe that i was right
we are going to be okay
but in our efforts by influencing the way we exist in this planet as a species we need to include and consider all the costs even the real human cost of labor
the municipal waste what we think when we are talking about garbage they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation
it is a remarkable statistic
so in the flow of their days and their lives the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the trash of you take a moment to recognize them
take a moment to tell you thank you
my work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions
today i brought two recent projects like this
both of these projects are located in emerging countries one in ethiopia and the other in tunisia
in addition they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture
the first example began with an invitation to design a multi story mall in the capital of ethiopia addis ababa
this is the kind of construction that showed us as an example to my team and me about what we had to design
at first the first thing i thought was i want to go running
after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to highlight
in principle these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can not afford to buy things
second you need to employ a lot of energy because the skin with crystals generates heat inside so it is necessary too much cooling
in a city where this should not happen because it is about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year
and thirdly it does not look at nothing to do with africa nor with ethiopia
it is a shame for a place that is so rich in culture and traditions
in our first visit to ethiopia i was actually hooked up with the old market which is this open air structure where thousands of people go and buy things every day to little marketers
there is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity
so i thought that was what i really wanted to design not a commercial center
but the question was how do we build a modern building of several stories applying these principles
the next challenge came to the survey the site that is located in a very much growth area of the city where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image did not exist
and furthermore it is between two parallel streets that do not communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets putting all the entries in the building
and this spreads with an inclined atrium that creates a space to the free air in the building that is going through its own form of the sun and the rain
and around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses that changes on each floor because of the form of space
i also thought how to close the building
i wanted to find a solution to respond to local climate conditions
and i started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> of concrete in order to allow the air input and also light but in a way it is filtered
and then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of the dresses of ethiopian officials
they have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to model the facade
we are building that with these little bits that are determined that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building
this is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night
with these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought that is not a shopping center it was not what we do
but ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial mall because at the end of the day there were more local to sell
and also the idea of the facade it was much more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass but also because it was not necessary to have air conditioning
so we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project
the first thing was to think about how to achieve energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day
so we got a big advantage putting <unk> on the roof
and then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis
and these <unk> on the roof that together collect water for inner health
you are waiting for the early next year because we go on the fifth floor of construction
the second example is a master plan from 2,000 apartments and services in tunisia
and to make a project that is so big the biggest thing i have designed i needed not only to understand the city of tunisia but also their environment its tradition and culture
during that analysis i got special attention in the medina a year old structure of ancient years that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen doors of connected access by the straight lines
when i went to the place the first design operation that we did was expand the streets in order to create 12 early blocks similar to size and features in barcelona and other cities in europe with these courtyards
in addition to that we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the rigid doors with straight lines and this modified the initial model
and the last operation was to think of the cell the small cell in the project like the apartment as an essential part of the master plan
i thought what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the mediterranean climate
and it is north south because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation
so let us make a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction
and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city
it has these blocks with playgrounds and then on the plant down we have all the connections for pedestrians
and it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the ground down
and it also reinforces this idea of doors
the roof which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the busy space for construction
it is where all the neighbors can go up and socialize and make activities such as run a two miles in the morning or jump from a building to another
these two examples have a common approach in the design process
and in addition they are in emerging countries where you can see cities literally growing
in these cities the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings
for this reason i see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as objective to connect nature to people
thank you very much
when i was eight years old a new girl i joined our class was so remarkable as you see all the new girls
i had large amounts of hair very bright and a little <unk> of crayons it was super strong for the capital of the very good states to <unk>
i ended up that year and i was full of jealousy until i had my sinister sinister plan
one day i got a time after the school exit i was a little afternoon and i hid in the girls bathroom
when the coast was <unk> salt i walked into the classroom i took from the table of my teacher the <unk> book
and then i did
they altered the ratings of my rival just a little bit like that
all the way and i signed up to bring back the book in the drawer but to see some of my other partners had very good grades too
so in a frenzy and the notes around the world without any imagination
i put all of them to all of them of brushes and myself a row like this just because i could
i am still surprised what i did
i do not understand how the idea came from
i do not understand why i felt well doing it
i felt important
i do not understand why i never caught me
it is that it was all obvious
i have never discovered
but especially i am going to tell you the reason i was bothered by this little girl that was so good at <unk>
let me <unk> jealousy
they are so mysterious and so <unk>
we know that babies suffer from jealousy
also primates birds tiles are very likely
we know that jealousy are the number one of god's murders in the united states
and yet i have never seen a study that will spend loneliness or long duration or sadness
so you have to go to fiction because novels are like the lab that they are studying jealousy in all their possible shapes
in fact i do not know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there would be no jealousy <unk> would be literature
well there would be nobody else there would be no odyssey
there would be no king jealous or a thousand and one nights
there would be no shakespeare
you know <unk> high school lists because we would be losing noise and anger there would be no gatsby or party we will lose madame <unk> and anna k.
no jealousy there is no proust i know it is fashionable to say that proust has the answers for everything and how much of the jealousy jealousy you have all
this year it is 100 years of their masterpiece in search of lost time to lost the most residential study of sexual jealousy and also the ordinary competitiveness competitiveness mine everything we might have and thinking about proust we have got the details to be true right
we think about a child trying to reconcile sleep
we think about a <unk> <unk> in yourself
we forget about how hard that image is
we forget about the relentless which is
i mean it is about books that virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat
i do not know how <unk> <unk> but we assume it is <unk>
let us see why they go so well together the novel and jealousy jealousy and proust
it is going to be very obvious as the jealousy of jealousy the person to their desire to their fortunes are a strong narrative foundation
i do not know i think we get very close to the bone when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy
when we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story
a story about people's lives and those stories make us feel terrible because they are designed to make us feel bad
being in the same time storytellers and audience we know exactly what details put in to nail the knife right
jealousy we are doing all of the amateur novelists and that is something that proust understood
everything that she makes for me pleasure could give me pleasure to another maybe right now
and it starts to say himself that story and since then proust says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover he adds it to his collection of instruments in his private chamber
you have to admit that <unk> and proust was notoriously jealous
you know cmu forgiveness would have to leave the country if they wanted to break with it
but you do not have to be so jealous to recognize that it is a hard job right
jealousy are <unk>
it is an emotion that is hungry
and how are the jealousy
jealousy <unk> of information
jealousy the details use the details
jealousy you like large quantities of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of pencils
jealousy <unk> from photos
that is why instagram it is so successful sheikh links well language <unk> with jealousy jealousy
when he <unk> it is in their suffering of jealousy suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the servants of his lover then advocates that behavior
he says look i know you think this is revolting but it is not different at the interpretation of an old text or look at a memorial
he says they are scientific research with real intellectual value
proust is trying to prove that jealousy you see <unk> and they make us seem to look like <unk> but in their core they are search of understanding the truth really a painful truth in fact what proust is concerned about the truth better
pain humiliation loss these were the pathways to the wisdom of proust
he says a woman who needs us to suffer with it causes us a range of much more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can be interested in
it is telling us that we are going to look for cruel women
no i think it is trying to say that jealousy us reveal ourselves
and there is some other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way
there is some other emotion it reveals us our <unk> our awful ambition and our rights
some other emotion that teaches us to look at such peculiar intensity
freud would write about it later
a day freud was freud visited by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife will <unk>
and freud says that there was something strange about that man who did not stand on what his wife did
well she was innocent everybody knew it
the poor creature was under suspicion no because
but he was looking for things that his wife did not realize involuntary behaviors
she was smiling too much or would accidentally relate to a man
freud says that the man was becoming the title of his wife
so the novels are very good at this
so the novels describe very well how does the jealousy make us look at intensity but without precision
in fact the more intensely jealous we are more we become residents of fantasy
and for this reason i think jealousy lead us to do violent and illegal acts
jealousy lead us to behave in the way to behave
now i am thinking about eight years i recognize it but i am also thinking about this story i heard about news
a woman of michigan for 52 years old it was captured by having created a false facebook account from which he was sent to <unk> <unk> itself for a year
for a year every year
she was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her ex boyfriend i have to confess to you that when or this reacted with admiration
because let us be realistic
what massive though unfortunate creativity right
it is like a novel
as a <unk> <unk> novel
<unk> is one of my favorites
she is a very strange brilliant character of american literature
it is the author of strangers on a train and talented mr <unk> books that are trying to make sense of how jealousy <unk> our minds and once we are in the sphere in the kingdom of jealousy the membrane that separates what it might be can be rewarded in a moment
let us take a little bit more famous character
i took <unk> it goes from <unk> or want what you have to take from your own and <unk> from what you have ever got and he is under the floor responds to your name it takes your rings empty
it is a way
but what do we do we can not take the route of tom <unk>
i can not give you all the world as much as sometimes i want
it is a pity because we live in envy
we live in times of jealousy
i mean we are good citizens of social networks where the coin is envy right
the novels show us the exit i am not sure
so we are going to do what characters always do when they are not sure when they are in front of a mystery
let us go to the <unk> of baker street and ask for sherlock holmes
when people think about holmes thinks about the <unk> curse in professor moriarty that criminal genius
but i have always got a few of my favorite inspector <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that needs hindi desperately needs the holmes genius but he bothers him
oh it sounds so familiar
<unk> needs their help but <unk> it with bitterness in each of the mysteries
but how they work together something starts to change and finally in the adventure of six <unk> once he educates comes in all with your <unk> solution it goes back to holmes and says we are not jealous mr holmes
we are proud of you
and he tells you that there is no person in scotland <unk> who did not want to hold your hand
it is one of the few times that we see transferred transferred in history i think this is very emotional that scene is also mysterious right
it seems to treat jealousy as a geometry of geometry without emotion
you know in a minute alex is the opposite side of <unk>
the next minute they are on the same side
suddenly we are allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
it might still be so simple
what if jealousy is a kind of a geometry of geometry just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to the other
well maybe we do not have to get rid of the greatness of the other
we can do it with her
but i like contingency plans
so while we are hoping that that happens to remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
just fiction <unk> jealousy
i used them to invite them to the table
and look at what makes the sweet <unk> the terrifying thing tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the same marcel proust
we are in great company
thank you
we used to solve big problems
the 21st of july 1969 buzz aldrin jumped out of the icy module from apollo 11 and landed on the sea of the quiet
armstrong and aldrin were alone but their presence in the grey surface was the culmination of a collective collective process
the apollo program was the highest mobilization in peace history in american history
to get to the moon nasa spent about 180 billion dollars today or four percent of the federal budget
the apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 400,000 businesses and universities and the government
they died people including the crew of apollo 1
but before the apollo program 24 men traveled to the moon
twelve walked on his surface of which aldrin came from armstrong last year is now the oldest man
so why were they
they did not have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks and something that 24 <unk> later a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home
why was the cynical answer that was because president kennedy wanted to prove to the soviets that this nation had better rockets
but the <unk> words at the university of rice in 1962 they give us a better idea
john f. kennedy some ask why the moon
why do you turn it into our goal
and they might also ask why scale up the highest mountain
35 years ago why fly in the atlantic
why do they play rice against texas
we chose to go to the moon
we chose to go to the moon
we chose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things not because they are simple but because they are difficult
jason <unk> for the contemporaries the apollo was not just a victory of the west on the cold war
in the time the stronger emotion was the wonder for the transcendence of the powers of technology
it was because it was great to be able to do it
the landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological resonance
the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis
in the middle of the century it was <unk> <unk> and removed smallpox
technology seemed to own what alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> force
for most of the story of humanity we could not go faster than a horse or a sailing boat but in 1969 the crew of apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour
since 1970 no human being has come back to the moon
no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo 10 and joyful optimism about the power of technology has evaporated to see that problems that we imagine that the technology would solve as to go to mars create a clean energy cure cancer or feeding the world's population seem to be intractable
i remember seeing the apollo 17 launch
i was five years old and my mother told me that i would not look at the <unk> escape from the rocket saturn v. saturn
i knew <unk> that this would be the last mars mission but i was completely sure that i would come to see the colonies on mars
so that something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place
we heard it all the time
we have heard it over the last two days here at ted
it seems like the technologists they had distracted us and they had enriched with trivial trivial things things like iphone applications and social networks or algorithms that accelerate the automated sale
there is nothing wrong with most of these things
they have expanded and enriched our lives
but not the big problems of humanity
what happened
there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies that are in the age of the years where intel did microsoft apple and <unk>
silicon valley says markets are guilty of concrete incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs
silicon valley says that the venture investment caused us to change the creation of ideas by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems
but i do not think this explanation is good enough
it explains what is going wrong in silicon valley
even when venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about the risk they preferred small investments the minute they could go out in 10 years
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy that need a huge capital and that development is in the long term they have not been invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they do not have a immediate source
not the reasons we can not solve the big problems are more complicated and profound
sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems
could we go to mars if we want to
nasa has even designed a plan
but going to mars would require a political decision that were popular and that will never happen
we will not go to mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on earth
sometimes we can not solve the big problems because political systems fail
now less than two percent of the energy consumption of energy comes from renewable energy sources like solar wind and <unk> less than two and the reason is completely economic
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and oil is cheaper than <unk>
we want sources of alternative energy that can compete at price do not exist
now technologists the entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of an alternative energy mostly a significant increase in the r&d and energy development and some kind of control of the coal price
but there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of the you.s or international treaties that reflect that consensus
sometimes the big problems that seem to be technological they are not going to be
we know for a long time that hunger are a result of the failure of food
but 30 years of research have taught us that hunger are political crisis that affect the distribution of food
technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and load of food but there will be famine while there are bad governments
finally big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we do not understand the problem
the president nixon was declared the war to cancer in 1971 but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer some extremely resistant some of the treatment and only over the last 10 years seem to have been found effective and viable treatments
hard problems are difficult
it is not true that we can not solve the problems with technology
we can and we can but these four elements have been present to be present political leaders and the population must want to want to fix the problem the institutions must support the solution should be really a technological problem and we need to understand it
the apollo mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems with those criteria
but it is a <unk> model in the future
we are not in 1961
there is no competition as well as in the cold war there is no politician like john kennedy <unk> how hard and dangerous and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like to explore the solar system
in general to go to the moon it turned out to be simple
i was just three days
and it really was not even working on any problem
we are alone in our present and the solutions of the future will be harder to get
god knows that we are not missing the challenges
thank you very much
well i am going to talk about trust and i am going to start <unk> the most pervasive ideas that you have about trust
they are so common that they have become <unk> in our society
i think they are three
the first one is a claim there is been a great decline of trust it is a very widespread belief
the second is a goal we should have more confidence
and the third is a task we should be able to recover trust
i think they claim the goal and the task has been bad interpreted
what i am going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim a goal and a task that i think gives you a more clear idea about the subject
first the claim why people think that trust has decreased
and if i think about the basis of my own evidence i do not know the answer
i am going to think that there may be decreased in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others
i do not know it
but i can turn to polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased
when you look at the opinion polls over time there are no evidence of it
i mean the people who are <unk> 20 years ago mostly journalists and politicians follow inspired the same mistrust
and the people who were very reliable 20 years ago they are still quite reliable judges
the rest of us are in the middle and by the way the average citizen on the street is almost exactly half the way
but this is a lot of evidence
what the opinion polls are of course opinions
what else can register
what you are looking at is the generic attitudes that <unk> people when they do certain questions
they trust politicians trust teachers
now if someone asked you you trust them
you trust the fishermen
we trust elementary teachers
i would probably ask you to ask what do you do
and that would be a very sensible answer
and you could say when you have answered your question well i trust some but elsewhere
which is very rational
ultimately in real life we tend to deposit trust in a separate way
we do not assume that the level of trust we are going to feel for a given guy of official official or kind of person is going to be uniform in all cases
i could for example say i rely on a certain elementary teacher that i know to give you the kind of reading but in any way to drive the school <unk>
after all i could know that it was not a good driver
i could trust my most talkative more talkative to keep a conversation but not maybe to keep a secret
simple
and if we have got those evidence in our daily lives in the way that trust is separated why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in the most abstract form
i think polls are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence because they are trying to deal with the good judgment on the fact of trusting something or somebody
secondly what about the goal
the goal is to have more confidence
i think it is a stupid goal
it is not that the goal i am going to do
i would encourage you to have more confidence in what they are trusted but not what it is
ultimately i am keen to do not trust what is not reliable
and i believe that those people who are going to get their savings with the very rightly named mr madoff who then disappeared with them i think about them and i think well yes they were too confident
having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life
trust deposited or i.q is the right goal
once you say yes it says yes okay that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness
what it is about is doing a judgment on how reliable people are in certain aspects
and i think in order to be able to do trial we are forced to focus on three things
they are competent they are honest they are responsible
and if we found that one person is competent in commodities and it is responsible and honest then we will have a very good reason for trusting it because it is going to be worthy of trust
but if you are not responsible we could not trust them
i have friends who are competent and honest but they did not believe in them to take a letter to the mail because they are <unk>
i have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things but i see you will get your own skills
and i am really happy to say i think i do not have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely badly
if it is like this i did not notice
but that is what we are looking for trustworthiness before trust
trust is the answer
trustworthiness is what we have to judge
and of course it is hard
over the last few decades we have tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of professional institutions and officials and so on that they made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness
many of those systems have had the opposite effect
they do not work as they should
i remember once i was talking to a <unk> and he said well you will see the problem is that it takes more time to make the management paperwork that attend childbirth
and we found the same problem in all of our public and institutional life that the accountability system is destined to ensure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness actually is doing the opposite
what they do is they are difficult the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks like the midwives we are going to be able to use the boxes as we say
you all know similar examples
all of that for the goal
i think the goal should be more trustworthiness and things would be different if we were treated from being worthy of trust and we will tell people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust
it is not easy it is the trial the simple actions attitudes what is not done properly
third the task
i am going to call the task reconstruct the confidence it puts things backwards
it suggests that you and i should be reconstruct trust
well we can do it with ourselves
we can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness
we can do it if they are two people together trying to improve trust
but trust ultimately is distinctive because they give us some other people
you can not reconstruct what other people have given you
you have to give them the foundation enough so you can trust you
you have to be worthy of trust
and that of course is because you can not trick all the people all the time
but you also have to be able to be able to do that evidence that you are worthy of trust
how do you do that
that is every day every single part does the common people the officials institutions very effectively
i will give you a simple commercial example
the shop where i bought my socks he says i can pull them up without giving explanations
i am wearing them and bring me back the money or they change them by the color i want
that is great i trust them because they were vulnerable to me
i think there is a big lesson in that
if you become vulnerable to the other part that is a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you are saying
so at the end i think what we are aiming at is not a very difficult thing to figure out
what people rely on is relationships and in that framework they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust
thank you
from the beginning of computers we have been working working with the separation between us and the digital information the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be tested
this separation has been reducing more and more and more to such a point that today is less than one millimeter the thickness of a touch screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone
but i wonder and if there were no barriers
i started imagining what it would be
so first i created this tool that goes into the digital space so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is to transfers its physical body to the pixels
designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3d and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen
so with this tool you break the barriers
but the two hands still stay out of the screen
how do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of hands
in the <unk> of science at microsoft along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work
and so he combining a smooth bombsight with cameras deep to detect your fingers and the face now you can put your hands on the keyboard to get inside of 3d space and grab pixels directly with your hands
as the windows and the archives they have a location in real space it is so easy to grab a book of a shelf
you can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands
in these examples we are born in the digital world
and if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us
surely a lot of us would have bought and returned things by the internet
now that does not have to worry
so what i have here is a virtual search online
this is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or translucent when the system understands the geometry of your body
if we take this idea further i thought instead of just seeing pixels in the space how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them
what would be a future like that
at the mit media lab with my tutor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator <unk> post we created this only physical pixel
this spherical magnet behaves like a 3d pixel in space which means that so much the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three dimensional space
so what we did is we have been able to be naked gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation and mechanical and detectors and detectors
and in order to program digitally the object release it from the constraints of time and space which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and they are forever in the physical world
you can teach physically physically and distance and the famous shot of michael jordan you can reproduce as a physical reality the times we wanted
students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets the physics and unlike the monitors or the textbooks this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel very powerful
but what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities
as you see digital information we will not just show you something but that will begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world
we started the talk today talking about a barrier but if we discount that barrier the only limit that is left is our imagination
thank you
they trained me to become a woman for two years in <unk> china in the 70s
when i was in the first grade the government wanted to join a school for athletes with all expenses payments
but my tiger mother said no
my parents wanted me to become engineering like them
after surviving the cultural revolution they firmly believe that there was only an accurate path to happiness and safe and paid work
no matter whether i am working i would like or not
but my dream was to be an opera opera singer
this was me in my imaginary piano
an opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the tricks so i tried everything i was able to go to the opera school
so i wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show
but there is no adult <unk> it
no adult took me seriously
only my friends were supportive but they were children without authority like me
so at the age of 15 i knew it was too much more to train
my dream will never happen
i think that for the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing you would aspire to
and this was so unfair
so i decided to look for another calling
nobody around me wanted to teach me right
let us get to books
full works of <unk> aka <unk> lessons from the history of nan nan <unk> i came to america in 1995 and what were the first books i read here
those who were banned in china of course
the good earth is about life <unk> china
and it is not planning to understand it
the bible is interesting but strange
that is a topic for another day
but the fifth commandment to me was an epiphany <unk> to your father and your mother
honor i said it is so different and much better to obey
so it became my tool to go out of this <unk> trap and to reset the relationship with my parents
the meeting with a new culture also led to my comparative book habit
it gives a lot of perspectives
for example at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in china learn
i had never occurred to me that china did not have to be in the center of the world
a map involves the perspective of people
the comparative reading is not something new
it is a common practice in the academic world
there is to research fields like comparative religion and literature
compare and contrast gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject
and i thought if the comparative reading worked to investigate why not to do it in everyday life
so i started reading books from two
they can be people benjamin franklin from walter <unk> john adams john adams who were involved in a single event or friends with shared experiences
for the christ temptation are economic policies and spiritual
it is all psychological lust fear and the interesting social duty
if you know another language is also fun to read your favorite books in two languages
the path of <unk> tzu tzu thomas <unk> the road the road alan watts rather than lost in translation i found that you can win a lot of it
for example it is through translation that i realized happiness in chinese literally means joy
and bride in chinese literally means new mother oh oh
books opened up a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present
i know i am not going to feel myself or powerless never
having a broken dream really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered
i have come to believe that it is not the only purpose of a dream
their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams of where the passion comes from where happiness comes from
even a broken dream can do that for you
and it is because of the books i am here today happy to live again with purpose and clarity most of the time
so the books will always join you
thank you
thank you thank you
when i was in my 20s i saw my first client of psychotherapy
i was a ph.d student in psychology clinic in berkeley
she was a 22-year old woman called alex
and alex went to the first session using jeans and a studio <unk> jumped on the couch in my office took out the shoes and he said i wanted to talk about his problems with men
when i heard this i felt so relieved
my classmates had a <unk> like the first client
and i hit me a <unk> i wanted to talk about men
i thought i could handle it
but i did not
with the <unk> stories that alex brought to the sessions it made me easy only to move the head while we are going to get the solution
thirty percent are the new twenty said alex and so i saw she was right
you start to work later you get home later you have children after the death
for <unk> like alex and i had time to eat
but shortly after my supervisor i pushed myself to push alex to talk about his loving life
i was rejected
i said of course he is coming out with guys under the category he sits on a <unk> <unk> but it is not like it was to marry him
and then my supervisor said yet but maybe you get married with the next
moreover the best time to work in the marriage of alex is before you get married
this is what psychologists call a ha time
it was when i realized that the 30s is not the new 20s
yes people feel head after what they used to do but this did not have to have the early birthday to be pause in their development
this made the early york and the perfect moment and we were wasting it
so i realized that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and i had real consequences not only to alex and his loving life but for careers the families and the future of <unk> everywhere
there are 50 million <unk> in america today
this means 15 percent of the population or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the 1920s
raise your hand if you are in your 20s
i want to see the <unk> here
oh yeah they are amazing
if you work with <unk> they love a child you remove the dream a man i want to see it is fine amazing truth really matter
this is not just my opinion these are the facts
we know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years
this means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that they give your life to you have gone to when they have 30 and so many
more than 40 i do not stop in panic
this audience is going to be well i think
we know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money you will win
we know more than half the americans are married or they are coming out with their future partner at 30 years
we know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their 20s and <unk> for adulthood which means that if there is something you want to change themselves now it is time to change it
we know that personality changes more times during their 20s than at any time of life and we know that female fertility comes to its top on 28 and things become complicated at 35 percent
the 1920s are time for education about their body and their choices
when we think about the development of the child we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain
it is a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who will become
but what we do not hear is that there is something called adult development and our 20s are a critical moment in adult development
but this is not what people are listening to
the newspapers talk about changes at the timeline of adulthood
researchers call the 1920s a extended adolescence
journalists <unk> names <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
it is true
as a culture we have considered a triviality what is actually the decade that defines adulthood
bernstein bernstein to say that to achieve big things you need a plan and not enough time
it is not true
what do you think happens when you give it <unk> to the head and they say you have got another 10 years to start your life
nothing happens
they stole it to that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing
and then all of the smart smart people like you or your sons and daughters come to my office and say something like this i know my boyfriend is not good for me but this relationship does not just am killing time
or they say they all say that while you start a race before 30 everything will be ok
but then it starts to sound something like this my 20s are <unk> and i still have nothing to show
i had better rsum the day i graduated from college
and then it starts to sound something like that my dates over the 1920s were like the game game
they were all running and <unk> but then sometime around the 30s the music went on and they all started to sit
i did not want to be the only one i would sit down so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the nearest chair when i was 30
where are the <unk> here
do not do that
well that sounds a little bit extreme but you do not realize the risks are very high
when you leave a lot of things for the 30s there is a huge pressure on the 1930s and so many of them started a race to pick up a couple and have two or three children in a much shorter time
a lot of these things are not compatible and there are research that they start to show that it is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to the 30s
the post millennium age crisis is not about buying red sports cars
it is about realizing you can not have the career you want now
you realize you can not have the son you want now or you can not give a brother to your son
many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves and i sat in the room and talk about their 20s what i was doing what i was thinking about
i want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking
here's a story about how it might be
it is a story about a woman named emma
at the 25 emma she came to my office because he was in his own words having an identity crisis
he said he would like to work in art or entertainment but we still could not decide so that i spent the last few years working as a bullet
as it was cheaper to live with a boyfriend who showed more importantly than ambition
and even though i would live a very difficult old 20s his previous life had been even harder
i was crying often in our sessions but then he was getting out she does not choose your family but you can choose your friends
well an emma day he got his head on his legs and cried for almost every time
i had just bought a new book card for a directory and i had spent all the morning i would run with her many contacts but then he got seeing the empty space that follows after the words in case emergency please call me
i was at the point of hysteria when he saw me and said who is going to be for me if i have a car accident
who is going to take care of if i give cancer
at that time i took a lot of work to resist and i do not say me
what emma needed was not a really worried about it
emma i needed a better life and i knew this was his opportunity
i had learned a lot since i worked with alex as to just sit while the happiest decade of emma was going on
so for the next couple weeks and months i told emma three things that all ages man or woman deserves to know
first i said to emma you would forget about that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital
identity capital i mean to do something you add value to your person
doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later
i did not know the future of the race of emma and nobody knows the future of work but yes this identity capital generates identity capital
so now it is the moment for that work on the other side of the country of that company that they want to test
i am not <unk> exploration i am <unk> the exploration that should not be able to tell it is not exploration
it is <unk>
i said to emma you would explore jobs and i did that
second i said to emma that urban tribes are <unk>
the best friends are great to take you to the airport but the <unk> that you get together with friends with similar minds are limited in the way who you know what you know how they talk about and where they are working
that new piece of capital that new person who will come out almost always comes out of his nearest circle
new things come from what are called weak ties friends friends from their friends
yes half of the <unk> have a bad job or they do not have a job
but the other half does not and the weak ties are the way we were looking at this group
half of the jobs created it is never released then to meet the head of your neighbor it is a way to get a job not published
it is not cheating it is the science of how information happens
finally but not least emma i thought you do not choose your family but i know your friends
this was true when i was growing but like <unk> emma soon <unk> her family when i have a partner and form their own family
i said to emma that time to choose his family had come
you might think that 30 percent is better enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 and i agree with you
but to choose the person you live with now or you are going to do now when everyone on facebook start walking towards the altar is not progress
the best time to work in your marriage is before you have and that involves being so intentional in love as you are at work
choice your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it work or kill time with whoever you choose to you
so what happened with emma
well we looked at that directory and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state
this weak link helped him get a job there
that supply supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the living
now five years later it is special from events in museums
this married with a man who chose consciously
he loves his new career he loves her new family and i sent myself a letter to say now the emergency contact room are not big enough
the story of emma may sound easy but that is what i love to work with <unk>
it is very easy to help you
the <unk> are like airplanes that come out of the airport in los angeles that come out somewhere in the west
just before the takeoff a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between land or fiji
in the same way at the age of 21 or 25 and even 29 a good conversation a good break a good ted talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generations
here is my idea worth spreading all the <unk> you know
it is as simple as what i learned to tell alex
it is what i am now privileged to say to <unk> as emma every day the 30s is not the new 20s <unk> their age get identity capital use their weak ties pick your family
they will not be defined by what they did not know or what they did not
you are deciding your life today
thank you
when i was 27 years old i left a very hard job in management consultancy for a job that was even more demanding the teachers
i went to show mathematics to seventh grade students in new york city schools
and as any teacher i applied tests and testing
i give you tasks
when i work i would go back the grades
what i called the attention was that the i.q was not the only difference between my best and my worst students
some of those who had a better performance they had no i.q test scores
some of my smartest kids were not going so well
and that got me thinking
the kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade you are really difficult proportions to deal with the area of a parallelogram
but these concepts are not impossible and i was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough
after several years more than teachers i came to the conclusion that what we need education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a kind of psychological perspective from a psychological perspective
in education the only thing we know how to measure better
it is the i.q but what happens if we succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy
so i left the classrooms and i went to college to become a psychologist
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios and in every study my question was who is successful here and why
my research team and i went to the military academy west point
and we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
we went to the national competition and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in the competition
we studied teachers cars working in really hard neighborhoods and what teachers are still going to be teaching for the end of the school year and those who will be the most effective in improving the results of learning from their students
we teamed up with private companies asking which of these marketers are going to keep their job job
and who is going to make more money
in all these very different contexts emerged a feature like an important predictor of success
and it was not social intelligence
it was not good appearance physical health and it was not the i.q
it was determination
determination is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term goals
determination is to have resistance
determination is clinging to their future day after day not only for the month but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality
determination is to live life as if it was a marathon not a speed at all speed
a few years ago i started studying determination in public schools in chicago
i asked thousands of high school students who did the questionnaires of determination and then waited around more than a year to see those who are <unk>
it turns out that the kids with more determination they had significantly greater chance to graduate and even when i combined them in every feature that i could measure things like family income results even security that felt kids when they were in school
so it is not just in west point or in the national contest of zimbabwe where it matters determination also in school especially for kids at risk of <unk>
for me the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know the science about its development
every day parents and teachers ask me how to develop people's determination
what should i do to teach kids a strong work ethic
how are i motivated for the long term
the most honest answer is i do not know what i know is that talent do not give them determination
our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just do not follow with their commitments
in fact in our data self determination is not related or it is even related to talent measures
so far the best idea i have heard about developing people's determination is something called growth mindset
this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with the effort
dr <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge they are much more likely to <unk> when they fail because they do not believe that it is a permanent condition
so the growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination
but we need more
and that is where i finish my speech because that is where we are
that is the work we have in front of us
we need to take our best ideas our intuitions stronger and we need to test them
we need to measure if you have been successful and we need to be willing to fail to get it all over again with the lessons that we learned
in other words we need to be certain about making our children more certain
thank you
growing in taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty the shape and the shape of the chinese characters
since that time i am going through this incredible language
but for a foreign seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall china
in the last few years i have been wondering if i can bring down this wall so i want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language i can do it
i started thinking about how a new new method of learning chinese could be useful
since i was five years old i started to learn how to draw each of the strokes on every single character in the right sequence
i learned new characters every day for the next 15 years
because we only have five minutes better than let us do it in a faster and simple way
a chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters
you just need a thousand to understand the basic literacy
the first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read signs of traffic menus menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers
today i start with eight to show you how the method works
are you ready
open your mouth as much as you can until it is square
get a mouth
this is a person who is going to give a ride
person
if the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides as if i were yelling in a way silent help me i am burning this symbol actually it is originally originally in the shape of the call but i like to believe it is in the other way that will work
this is a tree
tree
this is a mountain
the sun
the moon
the symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old west
i call these eight characters
they are building blocks so you think many more characters
one person
if someone walks behind that is to follow
as the old said two are company three they are a crowd
if one person stretches their arms this person is saying it was that big
the person inside the mouth the person is stuck
it is a prisoner that is like <unk> inside the whale
a tree is a tree two trees together we have a forest
three trees together we also have the forest
put a chart under the tree we have the foundations
put a mouth on the tree that is an easy idiot to remember that a tree <unk> is quite an idiot
remember fire
two fires together it gets very hot
three fires together that is a lot of flames
put the fire under the two trees that is burn
for us the sun is the source of prosperity
two suns together prosperous
three together those are flashes
put the sun and the moon shining together that is the brightness
it also means morning after one day and one night
the sun comes out on the horizon
a door put a board inside the door it is the pedals of the door
put a mouth inside the door to ask questions
he played there is somebody at home
this person is coming out hidden from a door fleeing <unk>
on the left we have a woman
two women together they are discussing
three women together be careful is adultery
so we have gone through almost 30 characters
when we use this method the first eight radical will allow them to build 32
the next group of eight characters will build another 32
so with every small effort they will be able to learn a couple hundred characters which is the same thing that learns a eight year old
so after knowing the characters we started to create sentences
for example the mountain and fire together we have a mountain of fire is a volcano
we know that japan is the earth of the <unk> sun
this is a sun placed with the origin because japan is in china
so a sun next to origin we created japan
one person behind japan what do we have
a japanese person
the character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other
in ancient china that meant in exile because the chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains
today exile has become going out
a mouth that tells you to go out is a exit
this is a slide to remind me i should stop talking and go down the stage thank you
what i prefer to be dad is the movies i get to see
i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids when my daughter was four years old we saw the wizard of oz together
the film comes down his imagination for months
his favorite character was <unk> of course
he gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
but when you see that film so many times you get to understand that it is extraordinary
we now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial complex sculpture
however the magician of oz was an event in itself
it did not start that trend
the trend really took the rise 40 years later with interestingly another film whose protagonists a metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed like the enemy guard
you know what i am talking about yeah
there is a big difference between these two films there is a couple of big differences between the magician of oz and all the movies that we see today
one is that there are very little violence in the wizard of oz
the monkeys are pretty aggressive like the apple
but i think if the magician of oz is done today the magician i would say dorothy are the salvation of oz like prophecy predicted
you use a magical shoes to defeat the armies that is made by the <unk> of evil <unk>
but that is not what happens
another unique thing about the magician of oz is that the most heroic characters and even villains are women
i began to notice this when i did see star wars my daughter a few years later and the situation was different
at that time i also had a son
three years old
he was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that
but it was the second son and the level of supervision had come down so slid in the room and he was impressed as a mom leg with his stones behind and i do not think he understood what was going on but <unk> all
i wonder what would it be
they would be questions of value and perseverance and loyalty
it would have the feeling that luke come to an army to overthrowing the government
so let us compare this with the magician of oz
how do they win dorothy his movie
doing good access to everybody and being a <unk>
it is the kind of world that i want my children to grow up with oz and not a world of men who struggle that is where we are
why is there so much force capital f strength in movies for our children and so little on the yellow brick path
there is a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls and they should read it is very good
i have not read so much about how kids react to this stimulus
i know by experience that the princess <unk> does not give me the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is mixed i think at the moment of the first kiss i really hoped that the credit started to appear because it is the end of the movie right
my quest is finished i have a girlfriend
why are you standing there
i do not know what i should do
the movies are focused on defeat the villain and get your reward and do not leave time for other relationships or other adventures
it is almost like being a child you have to be a dumb animal and if you are a girl you have got to use a warrior suit
there are a lot of exceptions and defend the princess of disney first of you
but they send a message to kids even though they are not really their objective public
they do a phenomenal job when you teach girls how to defend the patriarchy but they do not necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy
there is no model for them
we also have some big women who write new stories for our children so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they do not stop being movies
of course the most successful theme of all time continues to emerge in classic after classic every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son or two men who breed a girl
until many of you are thinking this year i finally came out brave
i recommend it all of you are available in stores
remember what the critic said when it was brave
i can not believe that pixar is made a movie of a princess
it is very good not let it stop
well almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
i do not know if you have heard about this
it has not got roots and it is already spreading but maybe we will start a movement
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the mid-'80s i recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the movies that you saw
and it is very simple there is just three questions that you have to be done in the movie there is more than a female character that has lines
so you have to fulfill the requirement
these women talk about each other at some point in the movie
their conversations are about something else from the kid that they like okay thank you thank you very much
two women who exist and talk about things each other
i have seen it and yet very rarely i see it in the movie that we know and love
in fact this week i went to look at a very good quality film
truth <unk> <unk> <unk> an idea of consensus about what a hollywood movie is
it is pretty much the test of <unk>
and i do not think it should be because a lot of the movie i do not know if you have seen a lot of the film it happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostage crisis
we have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this hide and it is the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say come to the bed honey
this is hollywood
so let us look at the numbers
in 2011 of the 100 more popular films how many of them believe they have female protagonists
eleven is not bad
it is not the same percentage that the number of women we have chosen recently for congress then is okay
but there is a bigger number that this is going to disappoint this room
last year the new york times published a study that the government had done
this is what he said
in the united states one of five women says it is been sexually assaulted ever in their life
i do not think it is the fault of mass entertainment
i do not think the movies for children have something to do with that
i do not think music videos or pornography are closely linked but something is wrong and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think is there is a huge amount of sex sex
who are those guys what are you learning
what do you do not learn
they are <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain villain with violence and then they charge the reward that is a woman who has no friends and it does not talk
we are <unk> that story
you know as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to get it
we have tools that we are going to be able to be able to do and we expect that to help but i have to ask it is going to be able to protect yourself if at the same time active or passively we are educating our children to keep your male power
i mean the netflix list is a way to do something really important and here i mean mainly the parents
i think we have to show our kids boys a new definition of manhood
the definition of masculinity is changing radically
you have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
everything is changing
when i asked my daughter what was his favorite character of star wars you know what he said
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
what do they have in common these two
maybe it is not just the brilliant dress
i think they are experts
i think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anybody and they love to share their knowledge with other people to engage their potential
they are leaders
i like that kind of stories for my daughter and i like that kind of stories for my son
i want more stories like that
i want less stories in which i tell my child sees and more stories and more stories where it looked like their work is to join a team maybe a team led by women to help other people better and be better people like the wizard of oz
thank you
as a child i lived in maine and one of the things that i liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of maine because my parents told me that i would be lucky
but you know it is hard to find these shells
they are covered in sand and it is hard to see them
however over time i used to look for them
i started to see forms and patterns that helped me <unk>
this became a passion for finding things in love for the past and archaeology
and finally when i started studying <unk> i realized i will see with my own eyes it was not enough
because suddenly in egypt my little beach in maine i had grown up with almost 1,300 miles long along the nile
and my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities
this is really what led me to use satellite imagery
to try to make a map of the past i knew i had to see otherwise
i want to show you an example of how different we see from using infrared
this is a place in the eastern delta of egypt called <unk>
and the place to view seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color suddenly the place looks like pink
what you are seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of ancient egyptians
i want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an ancient egyptian city called <unk> lost for thousands of years
<unk> <unk> was the capital of the old egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the middle empire about 4,000 years ago
the place lies in <unk> egypt and it is really important because in the middle empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art ancient art architecture
the <unk> have always known that <unk> <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built it into the red circles here but somewhere in this enormous plain flat
this area is enormous it is about six miles per mile
first of the nile the nile was going right next to <unk> <unk> and as he changed over time moved on the east and he covered the whole city
so how do you find a city surface in a broad landscape
i am going to try to find it at random it would be the equivalent of a needle in a haystack with your eyes blindfolded and using baseball gloves
so we use data nasa's nasa to make a map of the place with very subtle changes
we were able to see where the nile was going to do
but you can see more closely and it is even more interesting this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here that we think might be the location of <unk> <unk>
so we collaborated with the egyptians scientists making it sampling this you can see here
when i say sample it is like the shots of sample in ice but instead of layers of climate change we are looking for layers of human occupation
five feet down below a thick of mud we found a dense layer of objects of pottery
this means that in this possible location of <unk> <unk> five feet down we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years which date from the middle empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk> <unk>
we also find <unk> jobs <unk> quartz and cat what shows that there was a jewelry shop there
this might seem that it is not a lot but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the empire and these are the stones that were used
so we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the middle empire in this place
we also have evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop which shows that what is been there was a very important city
we still do not find <unk> <unk> here but we will go back to the place in a near future to localize it
and even more importantly we have the resources to train young egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries
i want to finish with my favorite quote from the middle empire of the middle of the middle of it it was probably written in <unk> <unk> four years ago
sharing knowledge is the highest of all <unk>
there is nothing like that on earth
so it looks like ted it was not founded in 1984 d.c
make the ideas actually actually started in 1984 a lost city not for a lot of time and found from the high time
it certainly puts out of sea shells in perspective
thank you very much
thank you
i want to invite you to close your eyes
imagine standing outside the front door to the front door
i want you to pay attention to the color of the door to the material that is done
now let us take a group of <unk> obese in bicycles
they are competing on a bicycle <unk> race and they are in direction to their gate
i need you to see this really
they are strong they are sweating they are sweating a lot
and they collide in front of the door to your house
there are just flying down all over the wheels that goes on to the wheels of the wheels they end up in <unk> places pass the threshold of the door
in the lobby or what is on the other side of the door and look at the quality of light the light shines about the monster from the crackers
he is waving it with the hand
from his chair over a brown horse
it is a horse that talks about
you can feel your blue fur you can tickle your nose
you can smell the oats of oats and you go through it is about getting into the mouth
go through one side and come into his living room
in the room and making the maximum use of his imagination imagine britney spears
he is with time clothes dancing on his coffee table singing <unk> a little bit more time time
now follow me to the kitchen
the soil has been covered with a yellow brick path and from the oven coming to you dorothy the man of <unk> the <unk> and the lion of the magician of oz <unk> from the hands jumping towards you
okay open your eyes
i want to tell you about a peculiar contest that is done every spring in new york
it is called the memory championship of the united states
i went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist waiting i guess this was like the end of a wise <unk>
there were several men and a few ladies and different habits of hygiene
they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers look at them alone
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers
i am going to get full poems in just minutes
they compete to see who i could memorize faster the order of a deck of cards
and i thought this is incredible
these people must be an phenomena of nature
and i started talking to some of the competitors
this is a man named ed cook who had come from england and he has one of the best trained memories
i asked ed when you realized you were a wise one
ed said i am not a wise
i actually have an average memory
all of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory
we have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques in greece a 2,500 years ago in greece the same techniques that he used to memorize their speeches and the medieval academics used to memorize entire books
and my reaction was i would not hear about this before
we were standing outside of the hall of competition and ed who is a wonderful and brilliant english although a little bit <unk> he said josh you are an american journalist
you know britney spears
and i said what not why
because i would like to teach britney spears how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live in national television
i will try it to the world that anybody can do it
and i said well i am not britney spears but maybe you can teach me me
or you have to start something right
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me
i ended up happening most of the year after i do not just training my memory but also <unk> trying to understand how it works why sometimes it does not work and what the potential can be
i met a lot of really interesting people
this is a man called <unk>
he is <unk> very much with the worst memory in the world
his memory was so bad that i did not even remember that i had a memory problem it is awesome
somebody who was incredibly tragic but it was a window that allows us to see until point our memory makes us who we are
on the other end of the spectrum i met this man
this is kim logical on it they were based on dustin hoffman in the rain man
we spent a afternoon together in the public library of salt lake city memorizing phone books
and when i went back to return to a number of treaties on the writings written about 2,000 years ago in latin america and then in the middle ages
and i learned a lot of really interesting things
one of the most interesting things that i learned is that there was a time where this idea of having memory and successful and grown memory was not such a rare thing as it might like today
a long time ago people invest in their memory to provide their minds
these techniques have made our modern world but they have also changed us
we have culturally changed and i would say that they have changed so much cognitively
as we have almost no need to remember sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it
one of the last places on our planet where is still people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined trained memory is this competition so singular of memory
it is actually not so unique there is skills like this around the world
i was fascinated i wanted to know how these people do
a few years ago a group of researchers at university college in london invited a bunch of memory champions to the lab
they wanted to know that it has brains in some structural way or separate the rest of us
the answer was no
they are smarter than the rest
they gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not
there was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the memory of memory memory and the control guys that we compared to
when they put them in an mri mri machine their brains while <unk> numbers faces and forms of snow they found that in memory memory they are going to spread parts of the brain different from others
indeed they were using or seemed to use a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation
why is there something we can learn from this
the survival tournament competitive is driving as a military race where every year comes out with a new way to remember more things faster and then the rest of the competitors should get to the day
this is my friend ben <unk> three times a memory champion
on his desk in front of him there are 36 <unk> of letters that he is about to try to memorize in an hour using a technique that he invented and just he mastered it
he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> binary digits
in half an hour yeah
and while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these skills absolutely all the techniques used at the end it is just reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> coding
it illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the baker baker baker baker says the next i tell two people who remember the same word i say to you remember there is a man called baker
that is his last name
and then i am asking you remember there is a baker baker
and when i go back later and ask you remember that word i told you a while ago
do you remember what it was
the person who told you that his name is baker it is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is baker
the same word different ability to remember that is weird
what happens here
well the name baker actually does not mean nothing for you it does not have any relationship
with all the other memories that dance for their head
but the word baker we know the films
they use white hats
they have flour in your hands
they smell well when they come home to work
you probably know some baker
and when i was going to get that word for the first time we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some time later
one of the most elaborate techniques to do this data two 2,500 years ago in ancient greece
it is known as the palace of memory
the story says so there was a poet called <unk> who went to a dinner
they had hired him as entertainment because before i wanted to give you a very good party you did not get a dj he would hire a poet
he stood up <unk> his memory poem and left and so soon was the classroom of the dinner collapsed
killing them all
but not only killed all of them but it shattered the bodies to follow yourself unrecognizable
nobody could say who was there no one could remember where they were sitting
so they could not afford the bodies
a tragedy behind the other
i was standing outside just in the middle of the rubble shut up the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind i could see where he was sitting every guest
i took the family of hand bringing them out where they were their loved ones in the rubble
what you are going to know at that moment is something that we all know we know more or less intuitively and it is that no matter whether we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues we have visual visual memory and space
if you give them the first 10 words of the story i have just told you about <unk> it is very likely to get it very hard to do it
but i would bet if you are going to tell you that if you would say who i was sitting on the horse <unk> brown in your lobby would be able to get it
the idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember the more crazy funny funny funny <unk> and <unk> is the earliest image
this is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first treaties of memory in latin
and how does it work
let us say that you are invited to the ted stage to give a talk and they want to make it happen in the same way that it would happen if you had invited it to <unk> it is 2,000 years ago
what you might do is imagine they are at the door of your house
and to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous image crazy and unforgettable to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
and then you can imagine entering your house and see the monster from the crackers ed ed ed
and that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend ed cook
and then you would see britney spears to remind you that little funny anecdote that you want to tell
and then they walked in the kitchen and the room that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help them remember it
so it is like the romans speakers <unk> their speeches not word for words that are going to confuse it but typical by typical
in fact the typical term comes from the greek <unk> which means place
it is a <unk> of when people thought in the oratory and rhetoric with this kind of space terms
the phrase first in the first place would be like the first place in his memory palace
i saw this was just fascinating and i got stuck with that
i went to some of these memory skills and i had the idea of writing something broad about this subculture of competitive <unk>
but there was a problem
the problem was that a memory competition is a boring boring event
seriously it is like looking at a lot of people sitting on tests i mean that the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else is going on the front
i am a journalist and i need to be able to write about something
i know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people but i do not have access
i realized that if i was going to tell this story i needed to try to put myself in his place
so i started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning i saw the new york times just trying to remember something
maybe a poem or the names of an old school repository school bought in a <unk> market
and i discovered that this was fun
i would never have expected to be
it was fun because it was not just about training memory
what it is about to do is to make it better more and more the ability to create and imagine these very ridiculous ridiculous visual images and i wish you are in the eye of the mind
i was hooked on this
this is me using my standard training team for memory competition
it is a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor competitor
i ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before i had the idea that i could enter a kind of participatory journalism experiment
i thought this could be a good job for all my research
the problem was that the experiment came out of control
and i won the competition something i did not have to happen
of course it is nice to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists but actually this is not the point
so these are just tricks of tricks that work
because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works
and it is not necessary to be built from memory or memorize <unk> of cards to benefit with a little bit of insight about how your mind works
often we are talking about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift but it is not the case
the great memories are educated
the most basic level we remember when we pay attention
we remember when we focus deeply
the palace of memory these memory techniques are just shortcuts
in fact they are not even shortcuts
they work because they make us <unk>
it force a kind of profound processing a kind of complete attention that most people are not going to go out there
but the reality is no shortcuts
this is how things become memorable
and if there is something i want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> that i could not even remember that i had a memory problem i left me which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories
how much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence of existence in your blackberries or iphone not paying attention to the human being in front of us who walks our side we will be so <unk> that we do not even ourselves in process
i learned firsthand that there are incredible memory abilities in all of us
but if you want to live a memorable life you have to be the kind of person remembering to remember
thank you
today i will talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture
it is a lot to cover in 18 minutes
it is a complex topic so i will just give you a complex new jersey
because 30 years ago i am from 1980 jersey i was six and i was living there at home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom bedroom
in the corner of my bedroom i was the bathroom i would share with my sister
and between my bedroom and the bathroom there was a balcony that gave the living room
and there everyone was going on looking at the telly so every time i went from my room to the bathroom everybody looked at me and every time i got myself and i would go back in a towel everybody saw me
and i was like that
it was awkward and i hated it
i hated that journey hated that balcony hated that room and that house
that is architecture
ready
those feelings those emotions that i felt that is the power of architecture because architecture is not about mathematics or division of areas but of those connections emotional gut connections that we feel in the places we deal with
and it is not surprising that we feel like that because according to the environmental protection agency americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof
it is 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture
that is a lot
architecture determines in ways that we do not even notice
that makes us a little naive and very very predictable
this means that when i show you a building like this i know what you think about you think about power stability and democracy
and i know you think about it so because we based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the greeks
this is a trick
it is a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings
it is a predictable emotional connection we have used this trick for a long long time
we use it 200 years ago to build banks
we use it in the 19th century to build art museums
and in the 20th century we use it to build houses
look at these stable steady solid <unk> in front of the elements
this is very very useful because building things is terrifying
it is expensive it takes a long time and it is very complicated
the people who build the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation and prefer to use ways that you know they are going to work
so we have got buildings like this
it is a nice building
it is the <unk> public library that was finished in 2004 in my hometown and you know it has a dome it has this round thing
but it does not have a lot to do with a library of today
that same year in 2004 the other side of the country came up another library that looks like this
it is in seattle
this library shows how we use the media in the digital age
it is a new kind of public equipment for the city a place to come together read and share
so how is it possible that in the same year in the same country two buildings both called libraries are so completely different
and the answer is that architecture works according to the principle of the pendulum
on one side there is innovation architects who are constantly driving new technologies new technologies new solutions new solutions for life forms
we gave them together and we gave them so much that we get away from people
all of the black this is you think we feel that we feel very well but we are dead inside because we do not have another option
we need to go on the other side and come back to us with those symbols appreciated
so we do it and we are all happy but we are all happy but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience the pendulum back forward and over and over again that we have done in the last 300 years and of course we have done it in the last 300 years
well 30 years ago we went out of the 1970s
architects were busy experimenting with the <unk> called <unk>
it has to do with the concrete
that is what you can guess
windows tiny small scale
something really really hard
so we zoom in at the 80s and we started to incorporate those symbols
push the pendulum again in the other direction
we take those ways we know that we like and discount
we added neon and we added cake and we use new materials
they love them
we do not give them <unk>
we took cabinets we took them into skyscrapers and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be unintended <unk> made of glass
the shapes are <unk> won in audacity and colorful
margarine became columns
soldiers grew up to the size of buildings
crazy
but it was the 80s that was great
we all spend the time in commercial malls we moved to the neighborhoods and there in the suburbs we can create our own architectural fantasies
those fantasies could be on the mediterranean to french or italian
possibly with a endless meal of bread
this is what happens with the <unk>
this is what happens with the symbols
they are easy they are cheap because instead of creating new spaces we learn memories from other places
i know very well and all of you know that this is not the tuscany
this is ohio ohio
architects are frustrated and we started making the pendulum again in the other direction
in the 80s and early 90s we started experimenting with the called <unk>
we are telling the historical symbols we now count with new computer design techniques and we find ourselves with new compositions in a few ways that are matched against other forms
this is an academic and <unk> and it is super <unk> you are totally excluded
usually the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction
but then something surprising happened
in 1997 the building opened this building
it is the guggenheim of frank gehry
this building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture
paul <unk> said that bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public critics in general they were completely completely agreed about a building
the new york times <unk> this <unk> construction
tourism in bilbao increased on a 2,500 when they finished the building
so suddenly everybody wanted one of those buildings los angeles in seattle seattle chicago new york city
everybody wanted one and gehry was everywhere
he was our first star architect
but how is it possible that these wild and radical forms how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world
and it happened because the media was going around them and quickly we learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism
we have created an emotional reaction with these shapes
the same thing did the main mayors of the world
so everybody believed that if they had these forms they had culture and tourism
this phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium went with other star architects
it went to delight and libeskind and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium actually started to go with all architecture digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption
think for example how do you eat architecture
a thousand years ago they had to have walked to the next village to see a building
transport is speeding up you can take a ship an airplane can be tourists
technology speeds up you can see in the newspapers on the telly and at the end we all are photographers from architecture and the building is transported beyond their physical location
architecture is everywhere now that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture
because architecture is moving so fast
it is not a long time for thinking about a building
it takes a lot of time to build a building three or four years old and in that time an architect can design two eight or 100 buildings more before knowing if i designed four years ago it was a success or not
because there is never been good feedback in architecture
that is how we find them with buildings like this
the <unk> was not a two year old movement but 20 years old
for 20 years we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
that is never going to happen i think because we are on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or the elevator and it is the media revolution
my theory is that when the pendulum applied to the media is starting to swing faster and faster until we are going to be on both extremes almost simultaneously and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol between us architects and you the public
now we can do symbols almost instant charge of something completely new
i will show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently
we were <unk> to replace this building that caught fire
this is the center of a village called pins on fire island in the state of new york
it is a vacation community
but that meant that two years before the building was already a part of the community and the drawings looked exactly the whole product there was no surprises
the building came to become part of the community that first summer when people started to get and share it in social media the building stopped being a building became a communication medium because these are not just images of a building they are the images that one made of the building
and as you use them to tell your story they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory and by charge these symbols we learn
i mean we do not need the greeks tell us how to think about architecture
we can tell each other what we think about architecture because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings
think about a second in those <unk> librarians
if that building was built today first we are going to the internet for new libraries
we would be bombarded with examples of innovation about what a library can be
that is ammunition
ammunition which can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the <unk> people and tell them that there is no unique answer to what is a library today
let us be part of this
this abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience
everything is different now
architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words and complicated pictures and you are already not a hapless audience that does not accept something i have not seen before
architects can listen to and you are not allowed by architecture
that means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another one is irrelevant
in fact we can go ahead and find right forward solutions to the problems facing society
this is the end of the history of architecture and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today
this means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city
this means that a stadium in brooklyn can be that a stadium in brooklyn and not a bad historical tablet of red brick on the base of what it should be a stadium
this means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings because we finally will be ready for ways that are going to produce
that means that the buildings are going into the whims of nature and not the opposite
this means that a parking garage in miami beach florida can also serve to do sports or yoga or you can get married there at night
this means that three architects can daydream in the east river in new york city and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that because it is no longer a customer
it means that no building is too small for innovation like this little hall of names so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to look at
because no matter whether it is a cow or a robot who builds our buildings
no matter how we build what matters is what we do
architects you know how to make buildings more friendly smarter and more friendly
we have been waiting for all of you
finally we are not on opposite sides
find an architect <unk> and work together to make better buildings better cities for a better world because there is a lot of play
buildings do not just reflect our society but they give them way to the smallest spaces the local libraries the homes where we form our children and the step of the bedroom in the bathroom
thank you very much
this is my niece <unk>
he just turned a year and he started walking
and it does that really great typical of the children of a year <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs
it is totally precious
and one of the things that i like to do for the moment is look in the mirror
she really loves his reflection
he laughed and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and you can
it is beautiful
apparently all of his friends do this and my mom realize i used to do it and he made me think when i stopped doing this
how is that suddenly we are not comfortable with our appearance
because apparently we do not like it
every month 10,000 people google i am ugly
this is <unk> she is 13 and she lives in denver
and as any teenager just wants to be honey and fit in
it is sunday overnight
it is preparing for the next week in school
it is a little fear it is a little confused because even though his mom says all the time it is beautiful every day in school someone says it is ugly
between what his mom tells you and what his friends or classmates say does not know who believe
so he makes a video of her and he publishes it on youtube and ask others please leave a comment i am nice or i am ugly
well until now i am getting more than 13,000 comments
some of these are so unpleasant it is not even worth thinking about them
we talk about a normal normal teenager that gets these answers into one of the stages of their most emotionally vulnerable life
thousands of people are posting videos like this in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way
but what is it going to do this
well teenagers today almost never are alone
they are under the pressure of being online and available all the time talking to <unk> i like to explain by sharing this is never done
we have never been so connected in a continuous way so young
as a mother told me it is like there is a party in his room every night
there is simply no privacy
and the social pressures that they go from hand with that they are cold
this environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of i like they have and the types of comments they get
there is no divide between a life online and real life
it is really hard to know the differences between what is real or what is not it
and it is also very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is being manipulated digitally
what is the most good thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context
and where are they looking for inspiration
well you can see the kind of images that are covers of the news news of girls
zero size models continue to dominate our <unk>
the <unk> technique is now a routine
and trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
for those who <unk> <unk> means pro anorexia
these trends are associated from women in popular culture today
it is not hard to see what young people are compared to
but kids are also immune to this
like the superheroes stars of sports and singers
but what is the problem with all this
well surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individuals okay
but in a culture obsessed with the image we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental endeavor to their appearance at the price of all other aspects of their identity
things like their relationships the development of their physical capabilities their studies and other aspects begin to suffer
six of every 10 girls would rather do something because they think they are not nice enough
these are not trivial activities
they are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contributors to society and the field of labor development
31 almost one of three teenagers are not interested in arguments in class they are trying to participate in the classroom of classroom because they do not want to call attention for their physical aspect
one of five are not attending classes at all for the days when you do not feel comfortable about it
and in the season of tests if you do not think you are good enough to you if you do not think you are thin enough you will get a smaller note on the average of your fellow who do not care about it
and this phenomenon has generalized in finland the united states and china
and they stay regardless of what these young people weigh
so in order to be clear we are talking about like you you see not how you are really
low self esteem on their body is <unk> academic performance
and it is also <unk> health
teenagers with little self esteem do less physical activity they eat less fruit and vegetables participate in more diets not healthy than you can take them to a food mess
they have low self esteem
they are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they are at greater risk of depression
and we thought it is for all of this for what they make better decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs diets triple surgery aesthetics sexual relationships at early ages and no protection and self <unk>
the search of the perfect body is pushing the health system and our government costs billions of dollars every year
and we are not controlling it
women who believe they are overweight again regardless of whether they have or do not have higher rates of them
the 17 percent of women do not present to an interview interview on a day where they do not feel safe with the way you see
think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy
if we could overcome this what is that opportunity
free this potential is interest for each of us
but how do we do that
well speaking for itself it does not take you very far
it is not enough
if you really want to change things you have to do something
and we have learned that there are three key forms the first is that we have to instill in their own body
we have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self esteem
the good news is there are lots of programs available to do it
the bad news is that most of these do not work
i was very surprised when i learned that a lot of good meaning programs without realizing make the situation worse
so we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not just going to have a positive impact but also a durable impact
and research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas the first is the influence of family friends and relationships
these six respects are very critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self esteem
one education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us that take the passenger's seat into the issue and we will be a better model to follow by women and girls in our own lives
challenging the current status of as women are seen and mentioned in our circles
it is not good to count with the contribution of our politicians at slices of hair or the size of their breasts or to imply that the determination or the success of an olympic athlete depends on the fact that it is not a great beauty
we need to start judging people so they are not as you see
all of us can start doing this taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks
we can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance
and let me ask you when was the last time you are going to get a mirror
so in short we have to work together as communities as governments and as companies to change truly our culture so that our children will grow to value all their <unk> to individuality the diversity the inclusion
we have to put people who is actually making the difference on a pedestal
by making a difference in the real world let us make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we will just create a different world
a world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves where the way they believe they are never going to be the ones who are or to reach what they want in their lives
think about what this can mean for someone in their lives
who is in mind
his wife
his sister
her daughter
her niece his friend
it might just be the woman who is going to two seats away what would it mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice in his inner voice that haunts me for not having long legs trace more slim feet smaller
what would it mean for her if we <unk> this and we would say free to their potential that way
right now the obsession of our culture with the imagery is <unk>
but let us get to our kids the truth
let us argue that the way you see is just a part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for those who are and because of what they do and as they make us feel
they <unk> self esteem in our schools
let us change each of us the way we talk about and we compare to other people
and working together as a community from small groups to governments so that the small <unk> of a year old today will become agents of insurance change in themselves tomorrow
let us do it
the five of november 1990 a gentleman called the <unk> <unk> i walked into a hotel in manhattan and killed the rabbi inspired <unk> the leader of the jewish defense league
they were initially innocent he was innocent but being prisoner for other charges under the company of others they started planning attacks to about 12 icons in new york including tunnels and the united nations headquarters
luckily those plans would be wiped out by an fbi informant
sadly the bomb in 1993 in the world trade center could not prevent it
later <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that bomb
<unk> <unk> is my father
i was born in pittsburgh pennsylvania in 1983 being a egyptian engineer with an american mother teacher school teacher in the two they made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood
only when i was seven years old our family started to change
my father taught me a form of islam that very few even most muslims come to know
by experience i saw that when people take time to interact not it takes a lot to want to want the same things in life
yet in all religion in all human group there is always a tiny fraction of people who were being able to be able to be able to think about their convictions that thinks you have to use all the possible media so that they all live like them
a few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he and some friends had been going to rush training in long island to practice
he said i would go with him the next day
we got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that without knowing our group was monitoring by the fbi
when i played my father i helped hold the rifle on my shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet
that day with the last bullet he shot the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of me especially ma all the goal burst
my uncle went back to others and in arabic he said <unk> <unk>
such a child
all of the comment gave them a lot of laughter but just a few years later i understood what they were so funny
you saw in me the same level of destruction that my father could because
those people later would be committed to put a stay charged with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the north tower the north tower center causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt to another 1,000
i admired those men
he called them <unk> who means uncle
when i turned 19 i had moved to 20 times that instability during my childhood i was not allowed to do a lot of friendships
every time i was starting to feel comfortable about someone it was time to pack and go to another city
as i was always the new face of the class often i was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white but will be the new one of the quiet class and two was enough ammunition
so most of the time he was going on home reading books watching tv or playing games
so for these reasons i did not develop social skills to say softly under <unk> under <unk> i was not prepared for the real world
i was raised opera judging people based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion
so how could i open your eyes
one of the first experiences that they had tested my way to think was during presidential elections
in a <unk> program i participated in the youth national convention in philadelphia
my group <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence as i had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life was something that i felt a lot of passion
the members of this group came from various backgrounds
one day at the end of the convention i discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship was jewish
it took several days to go out to the light this detail and i realized that there was no animosity between the two
i had never had a jewish friend and frankly i felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of the life had been done to me believe it was <unk>
another crucial moment came when i got a summer job on bush gardens a <unk> park
i found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures that experience was fundamental in the development of my character
all of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and for extension all the gay people were bad influences
by chance i had a chance to work with gay actors there in a show and i could see that several of them were the most kind and more critics that i would seen in life
having been bullied as a child i developed a sense of empathy to the suffering from others but it was not easy for me to treat nice people exactly the way i would have wanted to be treated
for that feeling i could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life
i do not know how to be homosexual but i know what it is to be tested by something beyond my control
then he came the daily show
every night jon stewart made me honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people religion or sexual orientation do not have anything to do with character
in many ways he became my archive in a moment where i was desperately happy
sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected and a jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life that my own extremist father was not in vain
one day i had a conversation with my mother about how i was changing my way to think and she told me something that i keep in my heart forever while alive
she looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has been enough with an endless agent and he said i am tired of hate
at that time i realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside
my real name is not <unk> <unk>
it changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life
so why did i decided to go out and put myself in a risk
well it is simple
i have done it because i hope someone someday who is about taking the violence i can hear my story and understand that there is a better path than even though i am going to get myself to this violent ideology and <unk> i did not get to make me a fan
on the contrary i decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice
i do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones by the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives
by the victims of terrorism i will talk against those meaningless acts as a rejection of my father
with this simplicity i put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race that children do not have to follow the roads of their parents
i am not my father
thank you thank you all right thank you very much
right now there is a film that is projected in their minds
it is an incredible <unk> film
it is in 3d and it is got sound surround what you hear and see right now but that is just the beginning
your film has smell flavor and texture
do you feel your body your pain your hunger your pleasure
it has emotions anger and happiness
it has memories as moments of your childhood that we project in front of your eyes
and it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking
the heart of the movie you are you who experience everything
this film is your flow of consciousness the subject of the mind and the world
consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of existence of the human being
each of us is conscious
we all have a own internal movie t and you
there is nothing we know more directly
at least i know i have a self awareness
i do not know that you are conscious
consciousness is also the reason to live
if we were not conscious nothing in our lives would make sense or value
but at the same time it is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe
why are we conscious
why do we have these internal movies
why are not we just robots that we are getting to produce results without experiencing the internal movie
right now nobody knows the answers to those questions
i suggest that to integrate consciousness to science you need some radical ideas
some people say it is impossible a science of consciousness
science by nature is objective
consciousness is subjective
so there can never be a science of consciousness
because for almost the entire 20th century that vision is
psychology is studying objectively behavior neuroscience studied the objectively brain but never just mentioned consciousness
even 30 years ago when ted started very few scientific jobs about consciousness
after 20 years it all started to change
neuroscientists like francis crick and physicists like roger penrose said now it is the moment for science <unk> consciousness
and since then there was a real explosion a flourishing of the scientific work about consciousness
and this work was fantastic it was great
but it also has fundamental limitations until the moment
the science of science in the recent years was the search of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness
we saw something about this kind of fantastic work that presented nancy <unk> a few minutes ago
now we understand much better for example brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feel pain or feel happy
but this is still a welfare of correlations
it is not a science of explanations
we know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we do not know why
i would like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what it is correlate
but in a sense those are easy problems
no offense to neuroscientists
there is actually no easy problems with consciousness
well do not addressing the real mystery central mystery of this matter why all process physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness
why is there a subjective internal movie
right now we can not understand it
and you can say let us give the neuroscience
it is going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like traffic phones like the hurricanes and we are going to find explanation
the classic <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors how do they operate traffic how do they work how they reproduce they reproduce and metabolizing the living organisms all of these are questions about the goal
that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a emerging phenomenon how we walk how we talk about how we play chess they are all questions about behavior
but when it comes to consciousness questions about behavior are in the easy problems
but the hard problem is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied by a subjective experience
and here's the standard paradigm of the emergence the standard paradigm of neuroscience actually still does not have a lot to say
i am a rare heart scientist
i want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time i would beat up my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms physical terms
but at the end i got to the conclusion that that did not work for systematic reasons
i think we are going to get myself at this point
we have a string of wonderful explanations we get used to this physics explains chemistry chemistry explains biology biology explains a piece of psychology
but consciousness does not seem to fit into this scheme
on one hand it is a fact that we are conscious
we do not know how to hold that idea to our scientific vision of the world
i think consciousness right now is a kind of an anomaly something that we need to integrate to our worldview but we do not know how
with an anomaly like this you can need radical ideas i think we need ideas that at the beginning we need crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way
there are some possibilities for those crazy ideas
my friend dan dennett who is here today
his crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness
the whole idea of the subjective film movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion
actually what you have to do is explain the objective functions the behaviors of the brain and this is studies everything that needs explanation
well more power for him
that is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely based on the brain
at the same time for me and for many others that vision is pretty close to just denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying
but i am in a different direction
in the time i want to explore two crazy ideas that i think can be promising
the first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks space time and mass
they are <unk> fundamental laws that govern as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics
these laws and critical laws do not explain in terms of the most basic terms
instead they are considered fundamental and that is where the world is built
sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
in the 19th century maxwell's found that you can not explain to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to tell the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts there is space of newton laws of newton then applied the basic laws of the electromagnetism and applied the
i think that is the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness
if you can not explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas there space time mass charge then by a matter of logic you have got to go on the list
the more natural it would be <unk> consciousness as something fundamental a fundamental brick of nature
this does not mean that suddenly it is not the object of science
it opens up the way to explain scientifically
so what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space time mass processes physical processes
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can relate to them in a <unk>
the situation of consciousness is something like this
we want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can relate to a t shirt
we still do not know what laws are but that is what we are looking for
the second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal
every system can have a degree of consciousness
this vision sometimes is called <unk> bread by all <unk> by mind every system is conscious not only humans dogs the mice flies even the microbes of rob knight the elementary particles
even a photon has some degree of consciousness
the idea is not that photons are smart or you think
it is not that a photon can be filled with distress when you think oh oh always traveling at the speed of light
i can never slow down and smell the pink
no no
but the thought is maybe photons can have some element of raw raw feeling some primitive precursor to consciousness
this may sound a little bit crazy for you
how did anyone think that crazy
in part this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing
if it is fundamental as space the time and the mass is natural suppose it can also be universal as others
it is also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us it is much less for the people of different cultures where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature
a deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that are going through thinking with the physical process it is <unk> consciousness with information
whenever there is information processing there is consciousness
it makes complex <unk> processing as a human self awareness
simple consciousness processing simple consciousness
something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed them with mathematical methods
it has a mathematical integration of information that is called phi phi which measures the level of information integrated into a system
and we are supposed to see phi has to do with consciousness
so in a human brain there is an incredible degree high of information integration a high degree of phi lots of consciousness
in a mouse there is a middle degree of information integration quite a pretty significant degree of consciousness rather important
but when you get to the worms microbes particles the degree of phi rises
the level of information integration is lower but it is not zero either
in the <unk> theory there will still be a different level of consciousness
in fact they gave a fundamental law of the high degree of phi <unk> high degree of consciousness
also another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract
it describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations but we do not talk about the reality that underlies underneath
like explains stephen hawking where the fire comes out of the equations
from vision <unk> the equations of physics you can leave them as they are but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness
that is what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness
according to this vision consciousness is the one that puts fire into equations
in that vision consciousness is not found outside the physical world as an additive species
it is right there in the center
so this vision i think <unk> vision has the potential to deal with our relationship with nature and can have social and ethical consequences quite serious
some of them can be <unk>
i used to think that i should not eat anything that had consciousness then i should be a vegetarian
if you are a <unk> and you take that vision you will have a lot of hunger
i think thinking about it this tends to transform your visions while what matters in ethical terms and moral considerations it is not so much the fact that the fact of consciousness but its importance and complexity
it is also natural asking for consciousness in other systems like computers
what about the artificial intelligence system of samantha in the movie <unk>
it is conscious
according to the vision of <unk> information she has a complicated information processing so the answer is yes it is conscious
if this is right they pose a pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
finally you can ask for the awareness of whole collective collective consciousness the planet
canada has their own consciousness
or a more local level a group integrated as the audience at a ted talk at this moment we have a collective collective consciousness an internal movie for this full ted group of the inner movies of each of the parts
i do not know the answer to that question but i think at least it is a question you have to take seriously
so this view is a radical vision and i do not know if it is right
i am actually safer from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing than the second one that is universal
vision raises a lot of questions many challenges like how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love
if we can answer those questions then i think we are going on the right way towards a theory of serious consciousness
if not well it is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy
we can not wait to solve it overnight
but i think we will finally get it to discover
understanding consciousness is the real key i think to understand the universe and to understand ourselves
maybe we just need the right crazy idea
thank you
i grew up in a small rural village in victoria
i had a very normal profile a very normal profile
i went to school i am obsessed with my friends with my friends younger
it was all very normal
and when i was 15 years old a member of my community came up to my parents because i wanted to go to a community award
and my parents said well that is very nice but there is an obvious problem
she actually has nothing done and they were right
i went to school i had good grades after school i had a bass profile in my mom and spent a long time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> creek
yeah i know what a contradiction
but they were right
i did nothing that was extraordinary at all
nothing that might be considered as an accomplishment if we take the disability outside the equation
years later i was in the second part of teaching at a high school in melbourne just after about 20 minutes in class 11 of a guy raised his hand and said hey when are you going to go to your speech
and i know what speech
well i would been talking about the insurance law for the good 20 minutes
and he said you know your favorite speech
when people in the wheelchairs are talking about <unk> things in school
usually in the classroom of acts
and it was when i realized this child had had experiences with people with disability as an inspiration
and we are not and it is not a fault of the boy i mean that is true for many of us
for us people with disabilities are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
we are not real people we are there to inspire
and in fact i am on this stage <unk> what i do in this wheelchair and you probably are waiting to inspire you right
well ladies and gentlemen i am afraid of <unk>
i am not here to get it
i am here to tell you that you have lied to us about disability
yes they have sold us the lie that disability is a bad thing to <unk> m
it is a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable
it is not a bad thing and it does not make you remarkable
and in the last few years we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media
you may have seen images like this the only disability in life is a bad attitude
or this one your excuse is <unk> indeed
or this one another before leaving <unk>
these are just a couple of examples but there is a lot of them
you may have seen one of the girl without the <unk> drawing with a pencil held by the mouth
you may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber carbon
and there is a lot of these images that are what we call porn inspiration
and i use the porn term deliberately because i would give you a group of people for the benefit of other people
so in this case we would get the disabled to the disabled people without disabilities
the purpose of these images is to inspire them to inspire them to be able to see them and think well by very bad that my life might be worse
i could be that person
but if you are that person
i have lost the number of times that they have been approached by strangers to express that you think i am brave or an inspiration source and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile
it was like i am going to get up in the morning and remember my own name and this is <unk>
these images are going to get these images to people with disabilities with disability people without disabilities
they are there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you or to put their concerns in perspective
and life as disabled person is actually a hard thing
we spent some things
but the things that we have gone through is not the things that you can think of
they are not relative to our bodies
i use the term disabled people because i am going to tell you the social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live in than because of our bodies or diagnostics
so i have lived in this body for a long time
i am very excited with him
it does the things that i need to do and i have learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do and that is what happens with the children of those pictures too
they are not doing anything outside the common
they are just using their bodies getting the best of their capacity
so it is really just <unk> in the way we do it by sharing those images
when people tell us you are a source of inspiration it says as a compliment
and i know why it happens
it is because of the lie because they have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable
and honestly it does not
and i know what you are thinking
i am here and you think of god <unk> you are not sometimes inspired by something
and i really know i am
i learn from other people with disabilities at all time
but i do not learn that i am smarter than them
i learn that this is a great idea to use a barbecue <unk> to pick up the things that fall out i learn the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery on the mobile phone on the battery of the chair
great
we learn from the strength and resistance of others not against our bodies and our diagnostics but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us
i really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the greatest injustice
it makes us hard life
and that quote the only disability in life is a bad attitude the reason that that is a lie is because it is not true because of the social model of disability
a lot of smiles on a stick of stairs has never done it will become a ramp
never smile on a television screen i will not make the subtitles for the deaf people
not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and integrate a positive attitude to turn all those books into braille
it is just not going to happen
i want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception but the norm
i want to live where a 15-year old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> <unk> you do not think of <unk> not <unk> in a chair
i want to live in a world where we do not have so low expectations of the people with disabilities that we will be able to get off the bed and remember our names in the morning
i want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities and i want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade at a high school in melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair
disability does not make us remarkable but question what you believe to know about it i know what it does
thank you
what do you have to see augmented reality and football football
and what is the average speed of a swallow without charge
unfortunately today i will just answer one of those questions so please do not get rid of
when people think of reality augmented reality thinks in minority report and tom cruise in the air but augmented reality is not science fiction
augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it and people need to know because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the internet and mobile phones
so how do we get to augmented reality
the first step is what i have put the google google glass
i am sure many of you are familiar with them
what you might not know is that google glass are a device that allows them to see what i see
it will allow you to experience what is being a professional athlete in the field
right now the only way to be in the field is that i try <unk>
i have to use words
i have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination
we can use google glass under a helmet and know what is running by the game of play to 100 miles h blood hitting your ears
we can know that it feels like a man of 110 pound man we are going to try and try and get it out
i have been there and i assure you it is nothing nice
i bring some videos to show you what is to use google glass under the helmet and give them an idea of that
unfortunately they are not pictures of the nfl practices because the idea of the emerging technology technology is a submarine up to the surface but we do what we can
so let us look at a video
chris <unk> let us go
it is horrible to be <unk>
a moment let us zoom in a little bit
ready
go
chris <unk> as you can see it is a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective
you may have realized that there are people the rest of the team
we have a video of them from the university of washington
<unk> field mice 54 mice 54 mice
blue eight blue eight
chris <unk> this is a little bit more about feeling being in the field but there is nothing to do with the nfl
fans want that experience
fans want to be in the field to be your favorite players and you have asked me on youtube and on twitter you can see from the angle of a field of field
or a corridor
we want to experience that
once we have that experience with <unk> and google glass how do we get it from full of how we take it to the next level
we took it at that level using something called oculus rift which surely many you know
the rift oculus has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created and it is not cheap
and i am going to show you why with this video
man oh oh
no no i do not want to keep playing no
oh my god there
ck that is the experience of a man on a russian mountain fearing for his life
what is the experience of a fan when you are going to go through a video of adrian <unk> across the <unk> string of a <unk> with the arm before i run and make an notation what is the experience of a fan
when i am going to be able to run through the court launching the ball down to the bottom of the web or <unk> making a wimbledon
what is your experience when it is a mountain to over 100 miles an olympic skier
maybe they were going to get the sales for adults
but this is not even augmented reality
it is just virtual reality
how do we get augmented reality <unk>
we will get augmented reality when the coaches <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think about how we use this to improve our teams
how do we use it to win games
because they always use technology to win
they like to win give you money
so here's a quick refresher on technology in the nfl
in 1965 the baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to their field <unk> so that he would play faster
they won the super bowl that year
other teams decided to imitate them
more people saw the party because it was more exciting faster
in 1994 the nfl i put radios on the <unk> of the field and then in the defenses
they had more viewers because it was faster more fun
in <unk> imagine that you are a player going back to your group and you see your next one you showed in front of you in a plastic bombsight that you have put on you do not have to worry about forgetting a little bit
or to memorize the strategy
they just go out the field and react
and the coaches want it because if you do not follow their instructions they lose games and they hate to lose games
if you lose games you would take you like a coach
and they do not want that
but augmented reality is not just a manual strategies
augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game
how would you do it
well a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the people who are down
you also get information from the hats sensors and accelerometers something that is already working on
and all that information you send it to your players
the good teams will know send it
bad guys will have information overload
this would lead to the good teams of evil
so your computer team will be as important as your scouts and data analysis will stop being a nerds
being also for athletes who would have imagined
what would it be in the field
imagine that they are <unk>
you get the ball and you get it
you are looking for an open receiver suddenly a flash on the left side of your bombsight you tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> it normally do not really look at it but the system of <unk> tell you
you move to the protection area
another flash will tell you that there is a open receiver
you toss the ball but they are going down
and the ball loses the trajectory
you do not know where to land however the receiver see in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race
it is approaching it takes the ball and run away
the audience gets crazy and fans have followed you from every angle
this is something that creates massive emotion in the party
i will make a lot of people look at it because people want to live that experience
fans want to be in the field
they want to be your favorite player
augmented reality will be part of the sport because it is too profitable to not be
but what i ask you to do is we want this one to be the only one use of augmented reality
we are going to use it just like bread and circus like our usual entertainment
because i think we can use it for something else
i think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show someone how it is literally being in the other person
we know what this technology is worth of links
it generates billions of revenues a year
but how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of the victim
how much is this technology for a gay in uganda or russia trying to show the world how it is being harassed
how much it is also going to be a hostile commander or an neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children so that you think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
ladies and gentlemen augmented reality is about
the questions that we make the decisions we take and the challenges we face depend on as usual
thank you
i recently retired after 23 years of service in <unk> <unk> of california
most of those 23 years old the country <unk> the south end of the county county which includes the golden gate bridge
the bridge is an iconic structure that is known for its beautiful views of san francisco the pacific ocean and its architectural style
unfortunately it is also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world
the golden gate bridge was open in 1937
joseph strauss engineer head of building the bridge said that the bridge is pretty much about suicide testing
suicide from the bridge is not practical or practical
but from his openness more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge
some people believe that traveling between the two towers you will take them to another dimension this bridge has idealized as such as it is like it is like it comes to you from all your concerns and pain and the waters that go down below <unk> your soul
but let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide
after a fall of four to five seconds the body stands against water about 120 miles an hour
the impact breaks the bones some of which drill vital organs
most people die in the impact
the ones that did not usually get into the water and we will not normally drown
i do not think that you see this method of suicide you will realize the <unk> of death you will face
this is the cable
except around the two towers there are 32 inches from parallel to the bridge
this is where most people have been able to have before they have been able to get their life
i can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge and in its darker moment it is very difficult to bring it back
i took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life
i want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the railing
when i started working on the bridge we did not have any formal training
we were fighting to channel the way through these calls
this was not just a bad service to those who see suicide but the officers also
we have come a long way since then
today the veterans officers today and psychologists train the new officers
this is jason <unk>
i met him on july 22 last year when you get a call from a possible subject sitting in the cord near the center
i said and when i arrived i watched jason talking to a officer of the golden gate bridge
jason was only 32 years old and he would flown down here from new jersey
in fact i would flown up here twice before the new jersey to try suicide from this bridge
after about an hour talking to jason we asked us if we knew the story of pandora's box
remembering the greek mythology <unk> created pandora and sent it to the earth with a box and he said never never open that box
well one day the curiosity could see it <unk> and she opened the box
from she went out of pests and all sorts of evils against man
the only good thing in the box was hope
so jason said what happens if you open the box and there is no hope
he stopped a little bit he leaned on the right and it was
this kind of smart e smart guy in new jersey i had just removed life
i talked to the parents of jason that night and i guess when i was talking to them he did not seem to be ringing very well because the next day the rabbi of the family called me to see what it was
the parents of jason had been asked
suicide damage will affect a lot of people
i am asking you these questions what would you do if a member of your family a friend or someone loved a suicide member
what would you say
<unk> what to say
in my experience you are not just going to talk but you have to listen
listen to understanding
not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you feel because you probably do not know
just being there you can be the inflection point you need
if you think someone is suicide you are not afraid of <unk> and ask the question
a way to ask you the question is others in similar circumstances have thought to end their life you have had these thoughts
confront the person in front can save the life and will be the inflection point for them
other signs to search for despair believing things are terrible and they are never going to improve helplessness believe that there is nothing you can do about respect social isolation and a loss of interest in life
i came up with this talk just a couple of days ago and i got an email from a lady and i would like to read you your letter
she lost his son the 19 of january this year and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago and it is with her permission and blessing that i read
hello kevin i guess you are at the ted conference
it must be a whole experience to be there
i am thinking i should go to the bridge this weekend
i just wanted to leave you a note
i hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends and so on
i am still pretty numb but noticing more moments to realize that mike will not go home
mike was driving from <unk> to san francisco to see the party of the 49 his father on january 19
he never got there
i called the <unk> police and the report like disappeared that night
the next morning two officers came to my house and reported that the dog car was down in the bridge
witness i would seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before
thank you very much for fighting those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves
who has not been previously wrong without suffering a real mental illness
it should not be so easy to end up with it
my prayers are with you for your struggle
the <unk> the golden gate bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay not a cemetery
good luck this week <unk>
i can not imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day and also the value to go ahead
i would like to introduce you to a man that i mean with hope and value
so on march 11 of 2005 i said to a radio call by a possible subject names on the bridge near the north tower
i drove my bike on the sidewalk and watched this man kevin <unk> on the sidewalk
when he saw me immediately the railing and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower
for the time and a half i heard as kevin talked about his depression and hopelessness
kevin decided for his account to go back to that lane and give life another opportunity
when kevin went back to him
this is a new beginning a new life
but i asked him what was he going back and gave the hope to hope and life another opportunity
and you know what he told me
he said i have heard
you stopped talking and just heard
shortly after that incident i got a letter from the mother of kevin and i have that letter with me and i would like to get it
dear sir <unk> nothing erase the events of 11 and you are one of the reasons why kevin are still with us
honestly i think kevin was <unk> for help
it is been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it is been properly <unk>
i adopted kevin when i only had six months completely unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank god we now know
kevin is in order as he says
give god thank you
honestly with you <unk> <unk>
and at the end she writes <unk> when i visited the general hospital in san francisco that night you are going to get them like the patient
oh yeah i had to solve it
now kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society
he talks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that his story inspire others
suicide is not just something i have found in work
it is personal
my grandfather killed himself with poison
that act in spite of finishing his own pain to meet him
this is what suicide does
for most people suicide or those who consider suicide they would not think to hurt someone else
they just want your own pain off
usually this is done only three ways to sleep drugs or alcohol or death
in my career i have answered and i have been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and called suicide calls around the bridge
those incidents i have been directly involved i have only lost two but those two are too much
one was jason
the other one was a man who talked about about an hour
and during that time i am going to get my hand on three times
at the end hand i looked at it and he said kevin sorry but i have to go
and he jumped
horrible absolutely awful
i want to tell you though that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge do not kill themselves
in addition to those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it that one one or two most of those people have said that the second one they leave the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live
i say to the people the bridge does not just connect <unk> to san francisco but also people
that connection or bridge that we do is something that everyone and every one of us must be able to use
suicide can be killed
there is hope there is hope
thank you very much
the world makes you are what you are not but in your inside you know what you are and a question makes you how do you become a question
i should be something unique in that sense but i am not alone i am not alone
when i became a model i felt i had achieved the dream i had had since a girl
my outside was finally consistent with my inner self
so for complicated reasons i will go later later when i look at this picture i think about it you did not get it
but last october i found that i am just beginning
we would all get into our families our religion our society our moment in history even our bodies
some of them have the value of free to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or the beliefs of the people around us
they are people who are always challenging the status quo what is considered accepted
in my case the last nine years many of my neighbors many of my friends my agent even ignored my story
i think this puzzle is called revelation
this is mine
i was recorded as a child at birth because of the appearance of my genitals
i remember my five years in the philippines in my house i was always wearing this shirt in my head
and my mom was wondering why do you always take that t shirt in your head
i said mom is my hair i am a girl
i knew then how to get it
gender has always considered unchanging but we now know that it is actually something more complex and mysterious
because of my success i never told you to share my story not because i thought it will be a bad thing but why the world is about those of us who want to break
every day i thank being a woman
i have mom dad and a family who accept me as i am
many are not so fortunate
there is a long tradition in asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender
there is a buddhist goddess of compassion
there is a hindu goddess of <unk>
and when i was eight i was at a party in the philippines that celebrated these mysteries
i was in front of the stage and i remember this beautiful woman came up in front of me and i remember that moment as if something else i am going to tell you this is the kind of woman i would like to be
and when i was 15 years old when he was still wearing man i met this woman called <unk>
it is the principal of a contest of beauty
that night she asked me why do not you lie in the beauty contest
he told me that if she participated she gets over the costs of inscription and the costumes and that night i won in the bathroom i won a roll suit and he was third finalist among more than 40 candidate
that moment changed my life
suddenly i was inside the world of beauty
not many people can say that their first job was in queen of beauty of beauty but i know i can
i also met the homeless goddess especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the philippines
but more importantly i met my best friends in that community
in 2001 my mom who had moved to san francisco called me and told me that passed my request from the green card that i could go to the you.s
i was rejected
i said to my mother mom i am having fun
i am here with friends i like to travel and be a queen of beauty
but then two weeks later i called it and said you know if you go to the united states you can change the name and the identity of gender
it was all i needed to hear
my mom suggested i put two and my name
she also accompanied me when i was running in thailand at the age of 19
it is curious that in some of the most rural cities in thailand to do the more sophisticated sophisticated surgeries
in that time in the united states it was necessary to be done before they changed the name and gender
so in 2001 i went to san francisco and i remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and women's women's women's faith
it was a great moment
for some people their identity document means power or power to get a drink but for me it was the license to live to feel worthy
suddenly my fears were seen
i felt i could conquer my dream and move to new york and to be model
many are not so fortunate
i think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
a young woman in new york city who 'd lived his truth but that <unk> put back to his life
for many of my community that is the reality that they live in
our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population
all the 20 percent november we make a global toll on the day of <unk>
i am on this stage thank you for a long story of people who were <unk> and stood up to injustice
these are marsha p. johnson and sylvia britannica
today i am coming out of the closet
i can not keep living my truth alone and just for me
i want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame and fear
i am here <unk> so that one day there is no more than 20 percent of november
my deepest truth i took me to accept what i am
they will do it you
thank you very much
thank you thank you thank you kt schulz <unk> a quick question
<unk> <unk> of course you will see i first thank you first to thank all my blessings
to my support network to my parents especially my family who itself is very strong
i remember all the time i have been to young young women that i have driven and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents could not embrace it i took the phone he called my mom and he said mommy can you call this woman
sometimes it worked other people is not just gender identity that is what is in the center of what we are right
i mean we are all assigned to a gender at birth and what i am trying to do is put on the table the theme that sometimes that assignment does not block and that there should be a space that allowed people to do and this is a conversation that we should have with parents with colleagues
now movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement
there is still a lot of work
there should be understanding
there should be space for curiosity and to ask questions and i hope you all be my allies
ks thank you very nice <unk> thank you
in many societies and tribal societies in many societies they are usually aware of their children but i am one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and i am proud of it
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007 and when they were able to put their efforts in 2011 to <unk> the youth national prize was made very famous a very popular girl in his country
before that was my daughter but now i am his father
ladies and gentlemen if i would take a look at the history of humanity the story of women is the history of the injustice of inequality of violence and exploitation
you will see in the patriarchal societies right from the beginning when when you were born a child your birth is not celebrates
it is not welcome and for her father or his mother
the neighborhood comes day her <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father
and a mother gets bored so much to have a girl
when you give birth to the first child the first daughter gets sad
when it gives birth to the second daughter and she would be <unk> and the hope of a son when shines his third daughter feels guilty like a criminal
not only mother suffers but the daughter was born the newly born daughter when it is growing too
at the age of five when i should go to school stays at home and i will offer her to her siblings
until the age of 12 in some way has a good life
you can have fun
you can play with your friends on the street and it can move through the streets like a butterfly
but when you go in the adolescence when she is 13 years old you are supposed to come out of his house without a male cart
it is confined to the four walls of their house
it is not a free person
it becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family and if you were going to get the code of that assumption honor could even kill
and it is interesting that this assumption of honor does not just affect life of a girl also affects the life of male male members
so this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of course honor
and there is a norm more of the patriarchal societies called obedience
it is supposed to be a good girl it must be very very humble and very <unk>
it is the criteria
the model of a good girl must be <unk>
it is supposed to be silent and support the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if you do not want
if you marry a man who does not like or if your marry with an old man has to embrace it because they do not want to be seen from <unk>
if you are very young they have to accept it
otherwise <unk> <unk>
and what happens at the end
in the words of a poet the marry <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and daughters
and the irony of the situation is that this mother <unk> the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children
and this vicious cycle continues and continues
dear brothers and sisters when he was born and for the first time believe me i do not like the newborn to be honest but when i was there and i looked at her eyes believe me i felt incredibly honored
and so much before i was born i thought about her name and i was fascinated with a jewish jew of freedom in afghanistan
his name was <unk> <unk> and i called my daughter like this
but when i looked at all of them they were men and i grabbed my pen and i took it a line from my name and i wrote <unk>
and when she grew up when she was four and a half years old <unk> in my school
you might ask why should i mention the admission of a child in a school
yeah i have got to mention
they can take it for granted in canada in the united states in many countries developed but in the poor countries in the tribal societies in societies in tribal societies it is a great event for the life of a child
applying in a school it means the recognition of his identity and his name
an admission to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life
i have five sisters and none of them could go to school and they would be surprised two weeks before when i was <unk> the canadian visa and i was in the relative to the family i could not remember the family of some of my sisters
and the reason was i had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document
that was the reason that i value my daughter
what my father could not get to my sisters and his daughters i thought i had to change it
i used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter
i am going to sit it up with me when my friends came to see me
they encouraged to go with me to different meetings
and all of these values i have tried <unk> in their personality
and this was not just for her just to <unk>
i have spent all these good values in my school and girls and boys
i used education for the emancipation
he taught my daughters taught students to forget the lesson of the obedience
i showed you to students to forget the lesson of the called <unk>
dear brothers and sisters we were fighting for more rights to women and we were fighting to have more and more space for women in society
but we found a new phenomenon
it was lethal for human rights and particularly for women's rights
it was called <unk>
that means a complete denial of participation of women in all social economic and social activities
hundreds of schools have lost
girls were banned in the school
women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets
musicians were silenced the <unk> girls and the singers killed
and they are going to talk about millions but a few talked and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights
it is really terrifying
at the age of 10 years she got up and got up to education
he wrote a newspaper for the bbc blog he was offered her for the new york times documentaries and i spoke on every platform he could
and his voice was the most powerful voice
it is <unk> like a <unk> around the world
and that was the reason that the taliban could not tolerate his campaign and on october 9 2012 was shot in the head
it was a day <unk> for my family and for me
the world became a big black hole
whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death i whispered to my wife i must blame my daughter to your daughter
e <unk> said please do not you
let us <unk> the fair because
you put your life in play by the because of the truth for peace and because of education and your daughter was inspired by you and joined
they were both on the right way and god will protect them
these few words <unk> a lot for me and i did not go back again
when <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut up i used to see a dark shadow which was <unk> by the face of my wife
but my daughter never complained
i used to tell you i am fine with my smile and i am going to tell you about my face
i am going to do well please do not worry
it was a comfort for us and <unk> us
dear brothers and sisters we have learned from her how to resist the hardest times and i am happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women it is like any 16-year old girl
he cried when he does not end up
he is fight with his brothers and i am very happy for that
people ask me what is special about my mentoring that has made it so bold as bold <unk> and <unk>
i say do not ask me what i did
i mean what i did not do
i did not cut their wings and that is it
thank you very much
thank you thank you very much thank you
i was operated from the brain 18 years ago and since that day the science of the brain has become a personal passion
i am engineering
and i want to tell you that recently i have joined the google group of google where i have had a <unk> in my seat the <unk> of google x visualization but all the work that i am going to talk about today about the science of the brain i did before i joined google or outside of my work there
having said this there is a stigma when you go to a brain operation
you are still like intelligent or not
it will not be like that you will be smart
after neurosurgery i was missing a part of the brain and i had to live with it
it was not the gray matter but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters
immediately after the operation i had to decide how many of a dozen powerful chemicals every day because if i did not take anything i would die in a few hours
every day over the last 18 years i have had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals and try to get them to keep on life
more than once i have saved myself
but luckily i have a soul of <unk> so i decided to go on to try to get the dose to try and get the dose because there really does not exist a map of course that says in <unk>
i started testing different mixes and i was shocked by looking at how small changes in the doses were dramatically changed my sense of who i was my way to think of my behavior with others
a particularly impressive case for a few months i tried doses and typical chemicals for a man from 20 and i was surprised by looking at how i changed my thoughts
i was always angry i thought all the time in sex and i thought it was the smartest person around the world and of course many times in the past i have met several types of guys like this or maybe some <unk> versions
it turned out as an extreme
but my great surprise was that it was not trying to be arrogant
in fact i was trying to try so much insecure to fix a problem that i had in front of it and it just did not happen that way
so i could not handle it
i changed my dose
but i think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to go through since then i am getting better with men
so what i was trying to achieve when they adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the operation my creative thinking my flow of ideas
ground thinking almost always in images and that became my key reference point how to get those mental images i use to create <unk> my ideas if you are trying to try new ideas and recreating situations
this kind of thoughts is not new
philosophers like hume descartes and hobbes see things like it similar
they thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing
now there are the people who challenge this idea and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works for me is simple for most of us mental images are fundamental to the thinking <unk> and inventive thinking
and so after several years i could find the point right and i have got already lots of great mental <unk> mental really good sophisticated and so good
now i am working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the computer screen
can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination just to lead to the world that has the front
or if a musician could extract the music of his head
there are incredible possibilities with this as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light
and the truth is that the only difficulty to do this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems
let me show you why i think we are fairly close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups more in neuroscience
they both used mri image image mri to represent the brain here you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his harvard colleagues
the column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image
the column of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while imagining that same image
the column on the right was created increments the contents of the central column on the left see that the difference is almost zero
this <unk> in many different individuals with many different images always with a similar outcome
the difference between seeing an image and imagine looking at that same image is almost zero
now let me share with you another experiment this is the jack <unk> lab in berkeley california
they were able to turn the brain down in alpine visual fields
let us put it in this way
so in this experiment i showed people hundreds of hours of youtube videos while they were able to get their brains to create a great pool of reaction in the brain to video footage
and then i showed you a film with new new people new animals new animals and while they are getting a new scan
the computer using just brain information with the scan of scanning it to show what it seemed like the person was seeing
on the right you can see the computer inferences and on the left the video that i showed you
this was leaving us
we are all right about it
we just need to improve the resolution
and now remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same image is created in the brain the same mapping
this was done with the brain scanning systems of the largest resolution systems available today and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years
now we need to increase the resolution a few thousand times more to get a deeper look
how did we get it
there are many techniques to do it
one is open the skull and introduce electrodes
i am not honored to that
many of them are proposing new projection techniques for images even i tell you with the recent outcome of mri first we need to ask the next thing this technology will be the end of the way
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger magnets but at this point that magnets more <unk> just offer small improvements in resolution not for thousands as we need
i propose this idea instead of larger magnets we do better magnets
we can create much more complex structures with arrangements slightly different like making a <unk>
and why does this matter
in the last few years a lot of effort in mri were to make really big magnets right
however most of the recent advances in <unk> with ingenious and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the transmitters and frequency frequency frequency in the mri systems
once instead of a uniform magnetic field we use magnetic patterns in the middle of the fm frequencies
so by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio radio frequencies we can increase a massive shape the information that you can extract in a single scan
in addition we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need
when we use mri we should be able to measure not just blood fluid but the hormones and <unk> that i mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity this is sleep
we will be able to write our ideas directly into digital media
can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through thinking
what would we be capable of
and how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter
you thought the internet is a big thing
these are great questions
it would be irresistible use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills
indeed this same tool could lead to the cure of alzheimer's and diseases
we have a few choices more than open this door
anyway choose a year to happen in five or 15 years
it is hard to imagine that it takes much more
we need to learn how to give this step together
thank you
i am going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet and not in a traditional sense not just the gay closet
i think we all have gathered
his closet maybe it is to tell some person for the first time he loves her or tell someone who is pregnant or tell someone who has cancer or any difficult conversation that you have been through life
and so all i closet is a difficult conversation and even though our topics can vary tremendously the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet it is universal
it is scary and we do not like it and it must happen
so many years ago i was working on the south side side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city and being there i had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> i do not get my armpits to quote my armpits i gave myself franco as a litany
and i am going to agree that by the <unk> of my short pants and i have got my head out i would say normally a little boy hey you are boy or girl
and he would show a little uncomfortable silence on the table
<unk> my jaw a little bit more i would take my coffee with an <unk>
the father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold look at his son
but i would not say anything and <unk> inside
and i got to the point that every time i went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years i was ready to fight
and that is a terrible feeling
so i promised that next time i would say something
it would have that hard conversation
so after a few weeks it happened again
you are a kid or a girl
a familiar silence but this time i was prepared and i was about to get in full of women's affairs on the table i had the dates of betty <unk>
gloria steinem dates
even a fragment of the vagina monologues that i would show
so i took a deep breath and i went down and my back to my back a four year old dress with a pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a feminist mourning question you are boy or girl
so i took a breath again i put myself out of her and i said hey i know this is a little bit confusing
i have the short hair like the guy of a kid and i saw a little kid but i am a girl and you know as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas
well i am more like a girl in a comfortable pajamas
and that little girl looked at me paying attention and said my favorite pajamas is purple and it has a fish
you can give me a <unk> please
and that was all there ok you are a girl
what about the <unk> i asked
it was the most easy conversation that i have ever had
and why because the girl of the <unk> and i were both honest one with the other
so like many of us i have lived in some escaped my life and i know often my walls used to be a rainbow
but within the dark you can not know what color are the walls
you just know how a feels like living in a closet
that is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours
i will probably give you 100 reasons why i am going to get out of my closet it was harder than coming out of your closet but this is the issue it is not relative
how hard it is hard
who can tell me that explain to someone who has declared bank bank is harder than saying that it has been fooled
who can tell me that this story that i tell is more difficult than telling your five year old kid you are going to get divorced
there is no more difficult thing there is only the hard thing
we need to stop storing it that is hard to respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our cabinets and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard
at some point in our lives we all live in cabinets and you can make them feel security or at least security than the other side of the door
but i am here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made up a closet is not a place to live
thank you imagine 20 years ago
i had a horse tail a dress and high heel shoes
it was not the militant lesbian ready to fight every child four in the coffee
i was frozen by the fear of <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever
my family my full family friends i have spent my entire life trying to do not disappoint and now the world turned around to purpose
i was burning the pages of a script that we have all followed for so long but if you did not toss that grenade will kill you
one of my launches was more memorable at my wedding wedding
it was the first time that many of the guests were invited to know that i was gay and when i did my full lady labor in my black dress and heels and i walked around the tables and finally i got to one where the friends were my parents people who knew me
and after talking a moment one of the women screamed i love nathan lane
and the battle of the gay story had begun
<unk> you have ever been in the castro
well yes the truth is we have friends in san francisco
well we have never been there but we have heard that is fabulous
<unk> you know my <unk> antonio
it is very good and he has never talked about having a girlfriend
<unk> what is your favorite tv show
our favorite program will and grace
and you know who love jack
jack is our favorite
and then a mad woman but in waiting to show her desperately his support to get me knowing that i was on my side finally he said to me i would go back to my husband sometimes my husband uses pink shirts
and i had an opportunity at that moment as they have all the scud launchers
you may have been easy to indicate where they felt like <unk>
it is not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
and what else can you ask someone but self sustaining
if you are going to be authentic with someone you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you get
that is how hard conversations are still my strong point
ask anybody i have come out
but i am getting better and i keep what i like to call the three principles of <unk> girl
now please look at this through the gay perspective but understand that what it takes out of any closet is essentially the same
number one be authentic
<unk> armor
that girl in coffee had no armor but i was ready for the battle
if you want someone to be genuine others must know that we also suffer
number two are direct just say it <unk> their patches
if you know they are gay you say it
if they say to their parents who might maybe be gay they will keep the hope that that could change
do not give you a sense of false hope
and number three and more important leave the complex
you communicate your truth
they will never be touched by that
and some of them can get injured insurance <unk> so they have done but never excuse me so they are
and yeah maybe some of you feel disappointed but that is something in them not in you
those are the expectations of them about what you are but not their own
that is the story of them but not from you
the only story that matters is that you want to write
so the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a grenade you must know that we have all been there before
and you may feel very lonely but they are not
thank you rock enjoy the clock
so intelligence what is that
if you look at the story of how intelligence has seen an example productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the question of whether a machine can think of it is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can swim
when <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critic to the pioneers of computing like alan turing
and so a few years ago i took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence
let us go back a step
first let us start with a mental experiment
imagine that they are from an alien race that you do not know anything about the biology of the earth and the field of neuroscience on earth no intelligence on earth but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the land and they have incredibly long lives so you can see the land for millions even billions of years
and you see a very strange effect
of course as earthlings we know that the reason would be that we are trying to save ourselves
we are trying to avoid an impact
but if you are from an alien race that does not know anything about this that does not have any concept on earth intelligence you would see a physical theory that would explain how until a certain time in time the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet mysteriously they stop doing it
and so i claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence
so in this program that conducted a number of years ago i studied a variety of topics through science through various disciplines that pointed out to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence
in cosmology for example there is been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately shaped for the development of intelligence and particularly for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future
finally in the planning of robotic movement there is been a variety of recent techniques that have been trying to harness the ability of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks
and so taking all these different issues and <unk> together i asked a number of years ago there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues
there is only an equation for intelligence
and i think the answer is yes what you are seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a e mc mc intelligence i have seen
so what you are seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is an f force that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action
it is acting to maximize the future freedom of action or keeping your choice open with a force you with the diversity of potential future accessible yes to an impending time future tau
in a few words intelligence does not like to get stuck
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open
and so having in account this equation is natural to ask what can you do with this
how predictive is it
it predicts the level of human intelligence
it predicts artificial intelligence
so i am going to show you now a video i think i will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation
narrator recent research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder or entropy during their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us
but what if that cosmological cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a deeper relationship
what if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long term entropy but actually it arises from it
to find out we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long term entropy in any system where it is found inside
surprisingly <unk> he could spend multiple animal tests of animal game playing human games and even make money to trade actions all that without you would say to do that
here are some examples of <unk> in action
just like a human standing without falling here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a cart
this behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to <unk> a goal
he just decided for her to balance the pole
this ability of equilibrium will have applications for robotic robotics and human care technologies
this capacity use capacity will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture
in addition to the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite extreme extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task
this capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of domains
so for example here we see successfully playing an pong game against itself <unk> their potential for play
so here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly struggling and keeps the grid well connected
this same capability of <unk> network also has applications in health care in energy and intelligence
here we are looking at <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships discovering successfully and using the panama canal to extend globally from the atlantic to the pacific
in the same way it is widely applicable to problems in defense autonomous logistics and transportation
finally here we see <unk> spontaneously out and run a purchasing buy strategy in a regular series of negotiation of actions successfully increasing assets under its exponentially management
this venture management skill will have broad applications in finance and in insurance
alex <unk> <unk> what you have seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools walking upright and social cooperation all derived from one equation that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action
now here's a deep irony
so let us go back at the beginning of the use of the robot the work <unk> there was always the concept that if we were able to do smart machines there would be a cyber rebellion
the machines got up against us
one of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades we have had the whole concept of cyber rebellion
it is not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world
it is all the opposite that the urge to take control of all the future possible it is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of general intelligence can actually come directly from taking control rather than being upside down
another important consequence is the search for objective
they often ask me how do you look for targets they fall out of this kind of framework
my equivalent to that statement to pass the descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence is the next intelligence it has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future
thank you very much
we are at a tipping point in human history something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call home
although in the last few years we have expanded so much our knowledge of how it fits the earth in the context of the universe
the kepler mission of nasa has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars which points that earth is just one between the billions of planets in our galaxy
kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them and blocking a little bit of that light that comes to us
the data gathered by kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance there is between them and their mother star
together this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and rocky like the earth planets of our solar system and also the amount of light they get from their suns
at the time this day clues about if these planets we find are habitable or not
unfortunately while we are finding this treasure treasure worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity
2014 was the warmer recorded
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are now disappearing in a matter of decades
these environmental changes that we have caused globally they have surpassed our capacity to change its course
but i am not a science scientist an astronomer
but i study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet
you might say i am looking for alien opportunities in the housing sector
now as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe i can tell you that the more i look at planets like planets more enjoy our own planet
each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet just discovered and the planets that we know better than our solar system
take our neighbor mars
mars is small and <unk> and even though it is a little bit further from the sun it can be considered a potentially livable world that is a mission like kepler
in fact it is possible that mars has been habitable in the past and partly it is why we studied so much to mars
our rovers like curiosity tracks their surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it
the satellites that orbit as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere of mars and they try to understand how mars has been able to lose their goldilocks
private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on mars
but even though all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet places that are linked in our imagination with ideas <unk> and pioneer compared to earth mars is a pretty awful place to live
let us take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that we have still left by colonize a lot of places in comparison with mars
even in the highest dry places in the earth the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away
i worry about this excitement by the colonization of mars and other planets i am going to get a big sad shadow of the implication and the belief of some that mars will hope there to save us from this single planet <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable
that is why i like that exploration exploration i am deep with this idea
there is a lot of good reasons to go to mars but to say that mars will be there to protect humanity it is like imagine that the captain of the titanic is to tell us that the party i am going to have place later on the boats of life thank you
but the goals for mars exploration and the preservation of the land is not true
they are not actually faces of the same currency the goal of understanding preserve and improve life in the future
the extreme environments here in our world look like aliens aliens
you just find it closer
if we can understand how to create and keep habitable spaces in the hostile and dmv areas of the earth maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that
i will leave you with a mental experiment the paradox of fermi
a lot of years ago the physicist enrico fermi said while having realized that our universe has been around for a long time and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe we should have found evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life until now
well where are you
well possible a solution to the fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough technologically to consider to live between the stars lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we are doing this development
it is arrogant to think that it is only selfish colonization we will save ourselves but the planetary preservation and exploration is able to work together
if we really believe in our ability to bring to the hostile environments on mars for human presence then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the goldilocks on earth
thank you
a few years ago i would get my own house
and while i was on the front porch looking at my pockets i realized i did not have the keys
in fact i could see the window that they were at the dining table where he had left them
so fast i tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all right
i thought i would call a <unk> at least i had my cell phone but at midnight a <unk> could take a long time to get it and it was cold
i could not go back home from my friend of jeff to spend the night well i had an early flight to europe in the morning after my passport and my suitcase
it would be expensive but i am sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at night so i thought despite the circumstances room right
i am a profession and i know a little bit about how the brain works under stress
it releases cortisol that increases your heart rate you will get the adrenaline and <unk> levels
and when i got to the <unk> counter at the airport i realized i did not have my passport
well i had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep
and i started wondering if there was something that could make systems that could put in its place that will avoid bad things
or at least if bad things happen to be bad than it is a total catastrophe
so i started thinking about that but even a month later my thoughts do not <unk>
i was having dinner with my colleague danny <unk> winning the nobel prize winner and a little embarrassed i told him that i broke the window and i had forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that i had been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
it is something that he had learned from the psychologist gary klein who had written this a few years before as well as <unk>
everybody knows what the <unk> is
every time there is a disaster a team of experts coming and try to figure out what went wrong yes
in the <unk> like explains danny you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong next to try to figure out what can we do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage
so what i want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
some of them are obvious they are not so obvious
i am going to start with the obvious
in the house a place for the things that are easily lost
this sounds common and it is but there is a lot of science that supports this thesis based on how our spatial memory works
there is a structure in the brain called hippocampus which has evolved over thousands of years to make a follow the location of the important things where the fish are where the fish are where the <unk> <unk> trees where they live tribes and friends and enemies
the hippocampus is the part of the brain that is going into the taxi drivers in london
it is the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts
and if you ask if someone really did the experiment they cut sense of squirrels and yet they could find their nuts
they were not using smell but the hippocampus that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things
but it is really good for things that do not really move so good for things that move a lot
this is the reason for losing keys from reading and passports
so at home <unk> a place for the keys a hook next to the door maybe a decorative dish
for his passport a particular crate
for his reading glasses a coffee coffee
if you take a place and they are <unk> with it their things will always be there when you look for them
what about travel
take on the cell phone a picture of your credit card license a venture driver's license for themselves to do in the cloud
if these things are lost or steal it can make the substitution
these are some of the most obvious things
remember when you are under stress your brain releases cortisol
cortisol is toxic and <unk> thinking
so part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time and you have to put the systems on their site
and there is probably no more stressful situation than when you are faced with a medical decision
and at some point we are all going to be in that situation that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a dear to help them with a decision
and so i want to talk about that
and i will talk about a very particular medical condition
but this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of these medical decisions and in fact for making social decisions and social decisions any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of the facts
so suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says i have received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit high
everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack heart attack
so you are thinking that you have high cholesterol is not the best then the doctor says i would like to give you a drug to help you reduce the cholesterol a <unk>
and maybe you have heard about statins and you know it is one of the most uplifting medication in the world today even it is likely to know people who take them
so you think i know <unk> <unk>
but there is a question that you have to do then a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors do not want to talk and companies companies even less
it is for the <unk> the number to deal with
and what is this the <unk>
it is the number of people who have to take a drug or to have a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person
and you have to think what kind of statistical statistic is that
the number should be one
my doctor did not tell me something if it was not to help me
but actually the medical practice does not work like this
and it is not a guilt guilt and if it is a fault of someone it is about scientists like me
we have not understood very well the underlying mechanisms
but the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works just 30 to 50 percent of the people
so the number necessary to treat the most widely prescribed <unk> which do you think it is
how many people have to take it before they help a person
300
this is according to the research of the <unk> researchers cynical <unk> and pamela <unk> independently in <unk>
i explored the numbers
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single single heart attack or another adverse event
now maybe think well one probability in 300 to go down my cholesterol
why not doctor <unk> the recipe anyway
but then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is <unk> from side effects yes
for this particular drug the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients
and those include terrible things debilitating pain pain and articulate gi pain but now you think five percent is not very likely to go to me yet take medicine
but a moment
remember under stress they do not think clearly
so think about how do we get this over time so you do not have to make the chain of reasoning in the act
300 people take the drug not a person have helped him five from the 300 they have side effects that is 15 people
you have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that will help you the drug
i do not say you should or not take the <unk>
i am just saying you have got to have this conversation with your doctor
the medical ethic it requires it is part of the informed consent principle
we have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not
you may be thinking i have launched this number in the air by the crash value but actually this number need to treat it is quite typical
for the surgery that is done more than 50 percent of the 50 <unk> of prostate cancer the number you need to try is 49 percent
this is 49 surgeries by a person who has helped
and the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients
those include impotent or erectile dysfunction yells idle by looking at it
and if you are lucky and it is one of that 50 effects only one year or two
so the idea of <unk> is to think before time the questions that you can argue that we are going to take the conversation forward
you do not have to do this in the act
and they also want to think about the quality of life
because you have an option a lot of times they want a shorter life free or a longer life that might have a lot of pain towards the end
these are the things they talk about and they think of now with their family and their loved ones
they can change the heat of the moment but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking
remember our brain releases cortisol under stress and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems
there is an evolutionary reason for this
face to face with a predator it is not necessary the digestive system or the immune system because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things are not responding to the clock they might be able to be the lunch so nothing that matters
unfortunately one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical logical thinking like danny <unk> and your colleagues have shown
so we have to train them to think about the future to this kind of situations
i think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all failing
we are all going to fail to fail
the idea is to think about the future how they might be those failures to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the harm or to prevent the bad things in the first place
<unk> at the night of snow in montreal when i came back from my journey my contractor i set up a hint of combination next to the door with a key to the gate of the gate in the same an easy way to remember it
and i have to admit that i still have lots of letters that i have not ordered and lots of email messages that i have not read
so i am not very organized but i see the organization like a gradual process and i am doing it
thank you very much
piano piano interpreter it is my favorite musical symbol
it means playing softly
if you are playing a musical instrument and you see a p on the score you need to touch it
two even more soft p
four extremely soft p
this is my drawing of a <unk> tree there you see that it does not matter how many thousands and thousands of p may have never seen a complete silence
that is my current definition of silence a very dark sound
i would like to share a little bit about the history of the american system of signs the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story
the french sign language came over the decade of 1800 and over the time we mixed with local signs and developed the language we know today as <unk>
so it has a story about 200 years
i was born deaf and i was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life
and i thought it was true
but now i realize it is not true for anything
sounds are a very important part of my life in my mind every day
as a person deaf who lives in a sound of sounds it is like i lived in a foreign country tracking their rules working behavior and norms without <unk>
so how do i understand sound
well i see how people behave and respond to sound
people are like my speakers and sound sound
i do learn and i will take that behavior
at the same time i have learned that i can create sounds and i have seen how people respond
so i have learned for example
do not get the door
do not do a lot of noise to eat the potato potato bag
not <unk> and when you are eating make sure not scratch the covered in the dish
i call this sound label
maybe i think of the sound label more than the average person does it
i am super macho of sounds
and i am always waiting for string the sound about coming next
there is this drawing
let us decide to decide
let us keep going on
<unk> for announce
you can see the <unk> does not have notes in the lines
that is because the lines already contain sounds through subtle <unk> and blobs
in the culture deaf movement is equivalent to sound
this is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
a typical <unk> has five lines
however for me to do whatever my thumb does it is not natural
that is why in my drawings i just have four lines on paper
in 2008 i had the opportunity to travel in berlin germany for an art residence there
before this time i had worked like <unk>
during this summer i visited museums and spaces of different galleries and while i went from one place to another i realized that there was no visual art there
at that moment the sound was the trend and it was called me attention
there was no visual art everything was auditory
now the sound has entered my art territory
i am going to get more of the art
i realized it does not have to be like that
in fact i know the sound
i know it so well it does not just experience through your ears
i can feel it in a touch way or experience visually or even as an idea
so i decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice
and everything that had taught me in the sound i decided to leave it and <unk>
i started to create a new body body
and when i presented it to the artistic community i was struck with the amount of support and attention i got
i realized that sound is like money power control social currency
in the background of my mind i always felt that the sound was alien was something from a person
and the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artwork or i could empower myself
i chose to get myself
there is a massive culture around talking about spoken language
and just because i do not use my literal voice to communicate to the eye of society it is like no voice at all
so i have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice
that way i am able to be relevant in society today
so in school at work and institutions work with many different performers
and his voice becomes my voice and identity
they help me to be heard
and their voices have value and weight
ironically asking to borrow their voices i am able to maintain a temporary form of value something like to take a loan with a very high interest rate
if i will not continue with this practice i feel that i could <unk> in oblivion and not have any social value
so with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music
and i was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
for example a musical note can not capture and express completely on paper
and the same thing can be said in <unk>
both of them are very high and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals as the sounds
i would like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to understand better how <unk> works
so imagine a piano
the <unk> divide in many different parameters
if you <unk> a different parameter for each finger while you touch the piano as the facial expression the motion of the body the speed of your hand and so while you touch the piano the english is a linear language as if you are going to just take one key at once
but the <unk> is more like a chord you need the 10 fingers simultaneously in order to express a concept of course or idea of <unk>
if you just change the chord would create a completely different meaning
same thing happens with music in terms of pitch and volume
in <unk> by using these different parameters parameters you can express different ideas
for example the signal <unk> in that
this is the signal <unk> on that
i am watching you
stare at yourself
oh <unk>
uh oh
what are you looking at
ah enough
so i started thinking and if i look at <unk> through the glasses of music
if i had to create a sign and <unk> it over and again it might be like a piece of visual music
so for example this is the sign of day the sun comes out and you put it
this is all day
if you get it and <unk> the speed visually you see it as a musical piece
the whole day
i feel the same thing you can say all night
all night
this is all night on this drawing
and this led me to thinking about three different types of nights last night during night every night
i feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two
this is how you express the time in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time
for example one hour is a hand two <unk> it is two hands the present gets closer and in front of the body the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back
so the first example is a long time ago
then used to and the last one which is my favorite with a very romantic idea and dramatic at once there was once
common time it is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by compass
however when i see the word time common i think automatically at the same time
see <unk> hand right my left hand
we have got the <unk> through your head and the chest
face <unk> photo paw common time in my chest my flash claw i am going to show you a shape of my hand called a flash
can you do it with me
everybody with high hands
now we are going to do it both in the head like my chest something like common time or at the same time
yeah good
that means in love in the international system
the international system as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the signs of signs around the world
the second one i would like to show you is this please do it with me
and now this
it means colonization in the <unk>
now the third please follow me again
and again
it is lighting in <unk>
we are going to do the three together
in love colonization and lighting
good job everybody
notice how the three signs are very similar they all happen in your head and the chest but they carry very different meanings
it is amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music
however today we live in a very very audio world
and only because the <unk> has no sounds automatically does not have social value
we need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value without sounds
and this could be a step to make a more inclusive society
and maybe people understand that you do not have to be deaf to learn <unk> and you have to hear to learn music
the <unk> is a treasure treasure and i would like you to have the same experience
i would like to invite you to open your ears open your eyes to participate in our culture and experience our visual language
and you never know they can even fall in love with us
thank you
denise <unk> <unk> hey that is me
as a child my parents told me you can do everything but then you have got to clean it
freedom involves responsibility
but my imagination had led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible
so i grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance i should say because adults would lie to us from the awful truth
when i get older i found out that adults also <unk> and that they are not very good to clean up the others
time i spent now i am an adult and i teach citizenship and invention in hong kong in hong kong
you do not have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with lots of garbage
so as good citizens we cleaned up the beaches and not drinking alcohol and if you are i did not give it
it is sad to say but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic
it is something creepy
and over the last few decades we have been coming out with these big ships and networks to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope and we classify them and we captured this information on a map
but it lasts for an eternity and it is very expensive and it is also very risky to use those huge boats
so along with my students with six to 15 years we dream about inventing a better way
we have transformed our tiny classroom in hong kong in a workshop
we started building this table of work with <unk> <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can participate
and i will tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools they feel great and safe
not exactly
let us go back to plastic
we collect plastic and we reduce it the size we found in the ocean which is very small because of its fragmentation
that is what we do
i will leave it to the imagination of my students
my job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> something that we hope to work
we decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces just <unk> information
by using a robot we took a picture of this plastic the children are very excited about robots
then we created quickly what we call a prototype
we are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch
and we transform light bulbs and web cameras and we assemble it in a floating robot that is moving slowly through the water and the plastic we have there and this is the picture captured by the robot
we see the plastic pieces floating around through the sensor while the computer on board processing is this image and measure the size of every particle to get a sense of the amount of plastic in the water
we put this invention step at a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will get it even more
the great thing about this project is that the students saw a local and boom problem they are trying to fix it immediately
i can research my local problem but my students in hong kong are very well informed
you see the news you look at the internet and you are going to get it out with this image
a child maybe less than 10 years cleaning a oil spill through the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> rainforest in bangladesh
they were very surprised because this is the water you drink it is the water where they bathe the water where they get fish where they live
you can also see that water is brown the mud and oil are also brown color and when everything mix is very hard to see what is in the water
but there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water
we built a very first prototype of a rat that can light through all sorts of chemicals that produce the spectra of different things that can help to identify what is in the water
we are doing this prototype with a sensor and we send it to bangladesh
the great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem or analyzing a local problem my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help and help other children
i can research a problem at a distance i was forced to do a second experiment and i wanted to go a little further and i wanted to get a more difficult problem and also closest to me
i am half japanese and half french and maybe remember that in 2011 there was a devastating earthquake in japan
it was so violent that began several giant waves called tsunamis and those tsunamis destroyed several cities on the east coast of japan
more than 14,000 people died in a moment
it also gives the nuclear energy plant from fukushima nuclear central to water
and today according to the reports of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the pacific ocean
today the entire pacific ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
if we go to the west coast we can measure the radiation of fukushima everywhere
but if you look at the map it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the japanese coast and most of the time it looks safe it is blue
well reality is a little bit more complicated than that
i have come back every year from the crash and researching independently with other scientists the earth the river and this time we wanted to take the kids
of course we did not take them the parents were not allowed
but every night we informed the control center here you see the use of different masks
it might seem like they did not take work seriously but they did because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life
and along with them we discuss the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do after the strategies the <unk> and so on
and to do this we create a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant
we created the map of elevation we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of radioactivity and filtering water to simulate the rain
with this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was filtering from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean
it was a big estimate
but based on this we organized a civil expedition the closest close to the nuclear central to date
we zoom in to a five miles of the nuclear central and with the help of fishermen from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracker of sediment as we invented and we built
so here we see a progression we have gone from a local problem to a global problem to a global problem
and it is been very exciting to work on these different scales also with open source technologies and very simple
but at the same time it has been increasingly frustrating because we have only been starting to measure the damage we have done
we have not even started trying to solve the problems
i wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things
so the classroom became so small so we found an industrial installation in hong kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact
it is in the center of hong kong and it is a place where we can work with chemical metal a little bit of optical biology you can basically build almost everything there
it is also a place where adults and kids can play together
it is a place where the dreams of kids can become actually the help of adults and where adults can be children again
students acceleration acceleration acceleration
so anytime we ask things like we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy
for example
or well we can help in the mobility of advanced age transforming their standard wheels into new electric vehicles
plastic oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies
we can not afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions
so citizens makers <unk> <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people and so they can actually do something about it
thank you
two twin domes two radically opposite design cultures
one is made out of thousands of steel pieces the other one of one silk silk
one of them is synthetic the other organic
one puts it on the environment the other one creates it
one is designed by nature the other for her
michelangelo said that when he looked at the gross marble marble he saw a figure that struggle to be free
the <unk> was only a tool for michelangelo
but living things are not <unk>
they grow
and in the smallest units of life cells take all the information for every cell to work and to replicate
the tools also have consequences
at least from the industrial revolution the design world has been dominated by rigors of manufacturing and mass production
the lines of montage have dictated a world made of <unk> parts the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects like <unk> from discrete parts with different functions
but you do not find <unk> of <unk> material in nature
think of the human skin for example
our facial skins are thin with pores
the skins of the back are thicker with small pores
you act mainly as the filter the other mainly as barrier and yet it is the same skin there is no parts there is no <unk>
it is a system that changes gradually its functionality through <unk> variation
here is a split screen which represents my view of the world divided twice as much of every designer of every designer and architect to work in between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism between henry ford and charles darwin
these two visions of the world my left hemisphere and the right and synthesis is shown in the two screens after me
my work on its most simple level tries to bring these two visions of the world away from assembly and approaching growth
you are probably wondering why now
why was it possible about 10 or even five years ago
we live in a very special moment in history a rare moment where four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we have never had access to before
and at the intersection of these four fields my team and i created
please know the minds and my hands of my students
we designed objects products and structures and tools through scale scale like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 feet in diameter with a fee that some day not very far to print entire buildings and graphics all day from microorganisms genetically modified forces that glow in the dark
here we have <unk> the jealous a archetype of the ancient arab architecture and it has created a screen where every aperture is unique size to model the form of light and heat through it
in our next project we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt this was for a fashion parade in paris with cavities it is like a second skin made from a single piece of <unk> in the flexible contours of the waist around the waist
along with 3d printing collaborator we print this layer and 3d skirt without seams between the cells i will show you more objects like that
this hull combines hard and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microns
this is the resolution of a human hair
it is also the resolution of a c.t scanner
that designers have access to this high resolution analytical and the synthetic instruments it allows to design products that will fit in not just the form of our bodies but also the physiological structure of our tissues
we have also designed an acoustic chair a chair for a comfortable chair and also it absorbs sound
the carter professor my collaborator came back to nature to inspire me and by designing this irregular surface pattern becomes absorbent
we print this surface of 44 different properties that vary in stiffness and <unk> and color points to the pressure points in the human body
its surface as in nature they vary its functionality not through addition to another material or another assembly but it is continually <unk> and perpetuating the material property
but it is the ideal nature
there is no parts in nature
i did not grew up in a religious jewish home but when i was young my grandmother was telling me the stories of the hebrew bible and one of them came to me and he got to define a lot of what it matters
as she wrote in the third day of creation god sends the earth to grow a tree out there
for that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between <unk> branches and fruits
the whole tree was a fruit
on change the earth made trees with branches and the branches and it stems and flowers
the earth created a world made of parts
i often ask myself what is the design if the objects were made from one piece
we would return to a better state of creation
so we are looking for the biblical material the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it
the second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp crabs scorpions and butterflies
we thought that if we can tune in your properties we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece
so that is what we did
we call it legal <unk> we asked a lot of shrimp husks the <unk> and we produced <unk> pasta
<unk> the chemical concentrations we have been able to achieve a wide range of properties from dark hard and opaque to light and transparent
in order to print large scale structures built a system with multiple differences of <unk> controlled
the robot could vary the properties of the material on the gait and create these structures made of a single three material five foot away
when the pieces are ready to dry them to find a natural way to contact with the air
so why do we keep designing with plastic
the air bubbles which were a byproduct of the printing process they used to hold up microorganisms <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago as we heard yesterday
along with our collaborators at harvard and mit <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar
for the first time we have been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more to windows
a tree <unk> out of fruit
working with an ancient material one of the first forms of life on the planet with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology we have transformed a structure that is made of shrimp husks in an architecture that acts like a tree
and here is the best part for things that are designed to biodegrade on the sea <unk> the marine life and placed on the ground they will help grow a tree
the fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system
we are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep our lives to travel
to do that we must master bacteria and control their flow
so as the periodic table we made our own new forms of life new forms of life created switzerland <unk> shaped and biological <unk>
i like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid alchemy only that instead of <unk> beautiful metals they are new biological perspectives in very small channels
this field is called microfluidics
we print our own 3d channels to control the flow of these bacterial bacterial crops
in our first piece of clothing combined two microorganisms
the first is <unk>
it lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water
and the second e. coli the bacteria in the human intestine
one becomes light in sugar the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment
but these two microorganisms do not interact in nature
they actually never met
they are here designed for the first time to have a relationship in a piece of clothes
think about it as evolution not by natural selection but evolution design
to hold these relationships we have created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract to help that flow these bacteria and to make them out of their way
so we started growing those channels into the human body <unk> the properties of the material according to the desired functionality
if we wanted more photosynthesis it is more transparent
now this portable digestive system when you stretch from one end to another 50 feet
this is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our small intestine
and here's how we are going to look at ted we are going to call it at ted we are very proud of bright liquids channels with life inside the clothes
thank you
mary incorrectly said we are constantly proven creatures only half it is done
what if design would provide the other half
and if we could create structures that increases living matter
and if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the broken tissue and within our bodies
think of this as a way of editing biology
i call this the material ecology
it is always going to go back to nature
now you know that a 3d printer print material in layers
you also know nature does not do it
it grows it adds with sophistication
so this cocoon of the worm for example creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which they are getting away
additive manufacturing is about this level of sophistication
it makes it through the combination of not two materials but two proteins in different concentrations
one acts as a structure the other is the glue or the matrix connecting those fibers to each other
and this happens through scales
the silk worm first turn on in the environment creates a piece of tension and then it starts reaching a cocoon of compression
tension and compression the two forces of life manifest in a single material
in order to understand better how this complex process works we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the line
we put it into a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm
however when you put the silk worm on a flat patch not within a box we realized that they would be a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
so we started designing different different environments and we have discovered that the shape the composition the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment
it is often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their cocoons his silk gets rid and it is used in the textile industry
we saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling one cocoon
they <unk> <unk> and we could create these things
so we climbed this process up to architectural scale
we had a robot <unk> making silk templates and we put it into our site
we knew that silk worms <unk> into the most dark and cold areas that we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure
so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat spreading the silk worms over the structure
we were ready to get the caterpillars
we asked them round worms to a online silk farm
and after those four weeks they were prepared to get rid of it with us
we put them carefully on the bottom edge of the scaffolding and while <unk> <unk> <unk> they put up eggs and life starts again like us but much much shorter
bucky fuller said that tension is the great integrity and it was right
the biological silk <unk> about silk silk turns out this whole pavilion its integrity
and in a little bit more than two or three weeks ago worms of silk 6,000 miles
in a curious symmetry this is also the length of the silk route
china's after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs
this could be used for 250 extra pavilions in the future
so here are the two visions of the world
a <unk> silk through a robotic arm the other empty empty arm
if the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials designers should bring these two visions in the world
what brings us back of course at the beginning
here's a new era of design a new era of creation which leads us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design that demands of us for the first time that we make in charge of nature
thank you
thank you very much thank you
raise your hand if you have ever asked them what do you want to be older
if you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time
you can do it with your fingers
three five three five five five
now raise your hand if the question what do you want to be older
it has caused them some kind of anxiety
any anxiety
i am somebody who could never answer the question what do you want to be older
the problem was not i had no interest but i had too much
in school i like english i liked the english and <unk> and art and i took the web sites in addition to a punk band called <unk> frustrated
you may have heard about us
and in general i like to test and persist anyway having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field
but over time this sense of boredom this feeling of this is not a challenge it comes to <unk>
and i have to leave it
but then i am looking at something else something totally different and i am going to get myself into it and i am just going to absorb myself and i feel yeah i have found my own and then again this point where i start to <unk>
and finally i want to leave it
but then i would like to discover something new and different and i would like to go into that
this pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons
the first one was because i was not sure how it was going to turn all this into a career
i thought i had to choose one thing to deny all my other passions and <unk> <unk>
another reason that caused me so many anxiety was a little more personal
i was worried that there was something wrong with this and something bad at me for nothing
i was worried about having a fear of engagement or being dispersed or <unk> or my own success
if you can relate to my story and these feelings i would like to ask you something that i would like to have a lot of fun
ask yourself where did you learn to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal meaning to do things
i will tell you where they learned it from culture
we ask ourselves first what do you want to be older
when we have about five years old
and the truth is that nobody cares about that age
it is considered an naive question to do nice answers in kids as being an astronaut or be an astronaut or i want to be pirate
i am going to get the halloween costume here
so this question gets us over and over again as we grow up in various ways p. <unk> high school students ask them you are going to pick in college
and at some point what do you want to be older
it is going to be a cute exercise before what it takes us out of sleep
why
if this question inspires kids to dream of what they might be does not inspire to dream with everything that might be
in fact just the opposite because when someone asks you what do you want to be you can not respond to 20 different things even though adults well meaning you know and say oh what cute but you can not be craftsman from violins and a psychologist
you have to choose
this is dr bob childs and he is a craftsman of violins and <unk>
and this amy ng of magazine turned out in <unk> volunteer and creative mom
but most kids do not hear about people like this
all you hear is they are going to have to choose
but it is more than that
the notion of life is very idealized in our culture
it is this idea of destiny or the real calling the idea that each of us has something to do what i am going to do for your time on this land and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it
but if you are somebody who is not connected in this way
what if there is a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do
there is no place for somebody like one in that framework
and so you can feel it alone
you can feel that it does not have a goal
and feeling there is something wrong with one
there is nothing wrong with you
you are a <unk>
a <unk> is someone with many different interests and creative activities
it is a breath like that
it could be able to help if you divide in three different parts of potential
and you can also use other terms that we are going to get the same idea as a <unk> scholar
during the age of the renaissance the ideal was who was okay <unk> in multiple disciplines
barbara <unk> refers to us as scanners
use whatever term you like or make yourself yourself
it seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community we can not agree with one identity
it is easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you have to beat
but what i have learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website is that there is huge strengths in this way
here are three superpowers <unk>
one the synthesis of ideas
i mean the combination of two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection
<unk> <unk> and rachel <unk> expressed their shared interests in maps of data and data visualization and design and design
<unk> is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry
so to <unk> and rachel came up with this unique idea for his 60s mix of skills and experiences
innovation happens at intersections
that is where new ideas come from
and the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of intersection
the second superpower superpower is a quick learning
when we <unk> we are interested in something we are going to do it
we see everything we can have in our hands
we are used to being beginners for it it was a lot of times in the past and this means that we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort areas
so many abilities are <unk> to other disciplines and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we pursue so we rarely started from scratch
<unk> <unk> it is a <unk> full time and an independent writer
as a girl who was an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory
now she is the fastest <unk> known
before you become a <unk> writer it was a financial planner
he had to learn the fine sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability to help to write compelling launches for editors
it is rarely a waste of time to go to what you are attracted to even if at the end of it
it is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have foreseen
the third superpower superpower is adaptability is to say the ability to transform anywhere you need in a given situation
abe <unk> is sometimes director of videos other pages of web pages sometimes a <unk> consultant of kickstarter sometimes teacher and sometimes apparently james bond
it is valuable because it makes a good job
he is even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of their clients
fast company company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development to thrive in the 21st century
the economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that may be able to be able to meet the needs of the market that we actually thrive
synthesis rapid ideas and learning and adaptability three skills where <unk> are very adept and three abilities that might be lost if they are pushed to reduce their goals
as a society we have a great interest to encourage them to be themselves
we have complex complex problems right now and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them
let us say they are in your heart specialists
they came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons pediatric
do not worry there is nothing wrong with you either
in fact some of the best teams make up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
the specialist can dive deep and put in practice ideas and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project
it is a beautiful relationship
but we all should design lives and careers that we are doing with how we are connected
and unfortunately at <unk> largely we are going to encourage you to be more like their partners
once you said this if there is one thing you take from this talk i hope that is this you are going to be able to do with the sub wiring whatever it is whatever
if you are a heart specialist then you get through all the media
that is where you give the best of it
but for the <unk> in the room including those who have been realizing to be one of them in the last 12 minutes i am telling you with their many passions
keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
explore intersections
embracing our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life
and perhaps most importantly <unk> the world needs us
thank you
in the year attributed to a woman called <unk> they led to a psychiatric domain in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and i could not remember even the most basic details of their life
his doctor was called <unk>
<unk> i did not know how to help <unk> him but she was able to be unfortunately passed away in 1906
after his death <unk> he did a autopsy and they found strange plates and it is in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before
even more surprising
if you were to have been alive today we could not give her more help than that he was going to give him 114 years ago
<unk> was dr <unk> alzheimer's
and <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis we now call alzheimer's disease
now since emeka medicine has advanced a lot
they have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections a lot of treatments for antiretroviral cancer for hiv displays for <unk> and much more
but it is been moved on the treatment of alzheimer's disease
i am part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for alzheimer's disease for more than a decade
so i think about this all the time
alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide
but by 2050 it will affect 150 million which by the way to include many of you
if you are expecting to live up to 85 years or more the chance to get alzheimer's is almost one of two
in other words there is the probability that you spend their 20s with alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or loved with alzheimer's
only in america alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year
one five dollars of healthcare is spent on alzheimer's disease
today it is the most expensive disease and their costs required a five fold increase in 2050 by 2050 as the generation of the baby boom
you may surprise you but alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation
but it is been done relatively little to fight
today one of the first 10 causes of death around the world alzheimer's is the only one that can not prevent cure or even slow their development
we understand less than alzheimer's disease because we have invested less time and money in the research of the same
the you.s government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that it costs us more alzheimer's disease and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer
the lack of resources is due to a more fundamental because the lack of consciousness
because this is what people know but everyone should have alzheimer's disease is a disease and we can cure it
for most of the last 114 years all of the scientists even have the scientists with alzheimer's disease with aging
we thought it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging
but there is only looking at a picture of a pregnant brain in comparison with a alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease
in addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer's reduce the lifespan and it is always deadly
remember dr alzheimer's i found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago
for almost a century we did not know a lot about this
today we know that they are made of protein molecules
you can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami
there are places on paper that are being made
and when it folds right these are going to end up in the inside
but sometimes things go wrong and some of the things are getting out of the outside
so this makes the molecules of protein to stick with each other forming groups that can form big plates and it is
that is what we see in the brain of patients with alzheimer's
we have spent the last 10 years at cambridge university trying to understand how this dysfunction works
there are a lot of steps and the identification of what happened to block is complex like inactivate a bomb
cutting a wire could do nothing
cut others can make the bomb explode
you have to find the right step that blocks it and then create a drug that does it
until recently they have been reduced the wires and expected the best
but now there is a diverse group of people doctors who is a geneticists who is a geneticists who are a geneticist physicists engineers and mathematicians
and together we have managed to identify a critical step in the process now you are testing a new kind of drugs blocking specifically this step to stop the disease
i will show you some of our last results
no one out of our lab has seen it yet
so let us look at some videos of what happened by testing these drugs in worms
these are the healthy worms and you can see they are moving normal
these worms on the other hand have protein molecules that stick each other into them as humans with alzheimer's disease
and you can see that they are clearly sick
but by giving our new drugs these worms at an early stage then we see that heal and they live a normal life
this is just a very positive outcome but research like this shows that alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and fix
after 114 years of waiting there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years
but in order to grow that hope of defeat alzheimer's we need help
it is not about scientists like me it is about you
we need to warn you that alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we try it we can <unk> it
in the case of other diseases patients and their families have the more research and putting pressure on governments the drug industry drug scientists and legislators
that was essential to move into hiv treatment in the late 80s
today we see that same unit to beat cancer
but alzheimer's patients often can not speak for themselves
and their families the hidden victims caregivers for their loved ones day and night are often too usages to go out and advocate for change
so it really depends on you
alzheimer's disease is not in most cases a genetic disease
everybody with a brain is running the risk
today there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can not create the change they need for themselves
help them talk for them and help to demand a cure
thank you
i published this article in the column of modern love of the new york times in january of this year
to fall in love with somebody else
the article is about a psychological study to create romantic love in the lab and my own experience to prove it myself a night last summer
so the procedure is quite simple two strangers <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal and then they both look at your eyes without speaking for four minutes
here's a couple of questions of example
number 12 if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability what would it be
number 28 when it was the last time you get it to another person
and only
he is mediated these are more and more personal
number 30 this is really going to get me tell me to your partner what do you like about it or she is very honest this time and i gave things that you would not say to someone you have just met
when i stumbled across this study a few years ago a really few years ago the embarrassment that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the ceremony
so it was a little bit skeptical about this process of making romantic love but of course i was also intrigued
and when i was able to test this study with someone who knew not particularly well i did not expect to fall
however we fell in love and i thought it was a good story so i send it to the spinal love column a few months later
that was published in january and now it is august so i guess some of you are probably wondering are still going together
and the reason i think they challenge this is because i have done this question over and over again in the last seven months
and this question is just what i want to talk about today
but let us go back to the topic
a week before i was published the paper was very nervous
i had been working on a romantic book in the last few years so i had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog
but one blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot and those were usually just from my facebook friends and i imagined that my article in the new york times would reach a few thousand views
and that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship
but as he had no idea
the paper was published online on friday at night and on saturday this happened in my blog
and sunday today had been called today and the good <unk> america
in a month the article got over eight million visits and i was to say something little prepared for this kind of attention
one thing is to foster trust in writing with sincerity on very romantic experiences but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship
and when people called them or write what they did every day for weeks they always did first the same question they still follow together
in fact when i was preparing this talk i did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase still still together
and several messages came immediately
they were from students and journalists and strangers like this
i was interviewed in radio and asked
i even gave a talk and a woman screamed at the stage hey <unk> where is your boyfriend
and i immediately put it red
i understand that this is part of the deal
if you write about your relationship on an international newspaper you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it
but i was not ready for the wingspan of the answer
the 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life
in fact the new york times published a complementary article for valentine's day who included the experiences of readers to test the study on them with different degrees of success
so my first momentum to all this attention was to be very interested in my own relationship
i said no to every request that we both did a public emergence together
i decline from television and refused to requests for pictures of us two
i think i was afraid to become icons <unk> from the <unk> process a range for which i did not feel at all qualified
and i understand that people did not want to know just if the study worked they wanted to know whether it really worked or whether it was able to produce lasting love not just an adventure but real love love
but this was a question i did not feel able to answer
my relationship was just a few months and i felt especially people asked the wrong question
how do you know if you would follow together or not and then tell them
if the answer was not to do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting
dr arthur aron wrote first about these questions in this same studio in 1997 and there the goal goal was not to produce romantic love
instead of that i was looking at interpersonal approach between college students using what aron called openness and sustained and <unk> and reciprocal
it sounds romantic right
but the study did work
participants felt closer after doing that several years later they also used the rapid friendship protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers
they have been used between members of the police and the community and they have used it among people of opposite policies
the original version of the story that i tried last summer that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact was cited in this article but unfortunately it was never published
a few months ago i was giving a talk on a little university of liberal arts and then a student came up to me and he said to me and he said to me i tried the studio and did not work
he seemed puzzled by it
and i want to say you are going to tell you from the person who you did
well he paused
i think she just wants to be friends
and i have got better friends
they felt that they did they get better better after testing the studio
he nodded
so it worked i said
but i do not think that was the answer that he was looking for
in fact i do not think it is the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love
i stumbled across the study for the first time when i was 29 and i was going through a really hard separation
i had had that relationship since i had 20 what all of my adult life and he was my first real love and i had no idea how or if i could live without it
so i went through science
i did everything i could find about the science of romantic love and i hoped that i could sort of <unk> the heart
i do not know if i realized this at the time i thought i am just researching for the book i would write but in hindsight it seems obvious
i thought if i was built with the knowledge of romantic love i would never have to feel so bad and i used to feel so bad
and all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another
i am more patient with love i am more relaxed
i have more confidence to demand what i am looking for
but i can also see myself more clearly and i can realize that what i am looking for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably
what i am looking for of love is a guarantee not just to be loved today and to be loved tomorrow but i will keep loved indefinitely because of the person i love
it may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together
the story that the media told us about 36 questions is there may be a shortcut to fall in love
there may be a way for some ways to mitigate something in implicit and this is a very attractive story because in love it makes us feel beautifully but it is also terrifying
but i think when it comes to love we are very willing to accept the short version of the story
the version of the story that question still follow together
and his content with an answer of yes or not
so more than a question i would propose that let us make questions more difficult questions like how you decide who deserves your love and who do not
how do you stay in love when things get harder and how to know when to cut and distances
how do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship or even more how do you live with the doubt of your partner
i do not know the answers to these questions but i think they are a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone
so if you want the short version of the story of my relationship is this one year ago a known year and i applied a studio designed to create romantic love we fell in love yet and i am very happy
but in love it is not the same to stay in love
in love it is the easy part
so at the end of my paper i wrote the love did not happen
we fell in love because we took the choice to be
and i shudder a little bit when i read it now not because it is not true but because at the time i had not considered everything that was supposed to make that choice
i did not think so many times we would have both to make that decision and how much of the time i will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he will always choose or not
i want you to be enough to have done and i said 36 questions to have chosen to love somebody so generous and fun and having expressed that choice in the biggest day of america
but what i have done instead is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that i do not really believe
and what i am looking for and what i might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true
i want the happy ending in implicit on the title of my article which is by purpose the only part of the paper i did not write
but what i have instead is the opportunity to choose to love someone and the hope that he will also love me and it is terrifying but that is the deal with love
thank you
i was raised by lesbian lesbian and in a way i came like a <unk> of the forest
in new york city a time ago something that really affected me but more details later
i will start with when i was eight years old
i took a box of wood and <unk> a dollar bill a pen and a fork in it somewhere in colorado
and i thought that some strange bizarre practice would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species stands for ideas for example how we eat spaghetti
i had no idea
anyway it is quite grace because here i am 30 years later and i am still doing boxes
at a given moment i was in hawaii i like to go in hawaii and surfing and surfing and all those things <unk> and i was making a collage for my mother
and i took a dictionary and i took her all the pages and i took a kind of <unk> <unk> style agnes martin i covered the resin and a bee stuck
well my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them so i added more resin on the canvas thinking i could <unk>
instead he happened the opposite in some way it seemed that it increased as much as if you were going to get the text with a magnifying glass
so i built more boxes
this time i started adding things electronic frogs strange bottles that i would find out the street everything i could find because i was looking for things my life trying to relate them and storytelling about these objects
so i started drawing around the objects and i realized that my god i can draw in space
i can flow <unk> draw just like a carcass of the crime scene
and i took out the objects and i created my own toyota taxonomy invented
first village that you might be able to do an idea
and then i did some insects and weird creatures
it was very fun to draw on the layers of resin
and it was great because i started building exhibitions and those things and i was making some money to take my girlfriend to dinner for example go to <unk>
it was great man
at some point i got interested at the human form sculptures of natural size resin with drawings of human beings inside the layers
it was great except for one thing he died
i did not know what to do because the resin was going to kill me
and i went to bed every night thinking about it
so i tried to use glass
i started drawing on the glass layers similar to the drawing in a window and then in another window and it had all of these windows together to make a three dimensional composition
and this really worked and so i could stop using the resin
so i did this for years and my work with something very big that i call triptych
for the triptych i was inspired as much in the garden of hieronymus bosch which is a painting in the museum of the meadow in spain
you know
well it is a fantastic picture
they say it is a little bit ahead of your time
well the triptych to explain this piece
it weighs 11 pounds
five feet long
it is a double face so it is 10 feet of composition
it is a little bit weird
well that is the source of blood
on the left there is jesus and groom
there is a cave where all these creatures with animals heads travel between two worlds
they go from the world of representation to this analog mesh underworld where they hide
this is where creatures with animals heads are heading to the lists of <unk> <unk> in the ocean
the ocean is comprised of thousands of elements
this is a god bird tied to a <unk>
billy graham it is in the sea the horizon the <unk> platform of the waldo waldo the refuge of osama bin laden is all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean
anyway also a kind of creature of creature
it is coming out of the ocean and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand goes out clouds
their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a screenshot that keeps the earth and the cosmos in equilibrium
so it is a aspect of the triptych
it is a little bit a narrative
that is the hand that it spits out
and then when you go on the other side it has a nose like a bird and it spits out clouds from this nose
it also has a five meter long tail a snake tail that unites the triptych
anyway his tail turn on fire by <unk> on a volcano
i do not know why it happened
things happen you know
his tail ends up on an eye of <unk> <unk> made of terror cards in 1986
you have seen them
they did in the 1980s as if they were baseball baseball cards
so i am going to get this to my last project
i am in the middle of two projects you call <unk>
this is a six year project to make 100 percent of these human beings
each one is a file of our culture through media and material they are going to be online dictionaries or magazines
but each one acts as a kind of archive in the way of being human and travel in groups of 20 four or 12
they are like cells they get together they divide
and you can walk between them it is a few years old
each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside
this has a little cave in the chest
that is the head it is the chest you can put it the entry
i am going to leave you through the rest of the body there is a waterfall that comes out of your chest and it covers the penis or not penis or whatever it has a kind of <unk> thing
it is a quick refresher of these works because i can not afford it for a long time
we have layers you can see
this is a game body in half
this is two heads and it is communicating between the two
there are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue
there is a little forest scene inside the ribcage
you can see it
anyway this talk is about these boxes just like the boxes that we live in
we are in a box the solar system is a box
this brings me to my last box
it is a brick box it is called <unk> <unk>
inside this box there is a physicist a neuroscientist a neuroscientist a musician a musician a writer a <unk> a museum a school an editorial arm which spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden
and the box <unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other like particles
and i think that is the way we change the world
when you behave who is and the box in which it is living
and together we get to realize that we are all together in this that this illusion that we are different these concepts of countries in the borders of religion it does not work
we are all very made of the same stuff and in the same box
and if we do not start trading those things with sweetness and whatnot we are all going to die very soon
thank you very much
what do they do when they hurt your head
they take an aspirin
but for this pill to have the pain of the pain first goes through the stomach the bowels and other organs
to take a pill it is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> effect on the body
the downside though is that by <unk> any drug is considered
and this is a big problem especially in patients with hiv
when you take antiretroviral drugs these are they <unk> the amount of viruses in the blood and increase the death count
but they are also known for their adverse side effects mostly negative effects because in the time that it takes to get to the bloodstream they are going to grow up and worse even for the time that it takes to reach their fate which is where it is more important in the hiv hiv
these are regions of the body like the lymph nodes the nervous system the lungs where the virus is dead and it does not easily come into the bloodstream of the patients who are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs
however after the treatment of treatment viruses can wake up and infect new blood cells
this is the big problem of treatment of hiv with current drugs which is a treatment of life managed for it
one day i sat down and i thought we could make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus without the risk of dying of drugs
as a scientist in lasers the answer was in front of me the lasers of course
if you are using dentistry for listening to wounds and surgery can be used for anything imaginable including transportation <unk> of drugs
in fact we are using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes opening up and close to almost immediately the infected cells with hiv to introduce drugs
they ask the best people ask how is that possible
we sent a small and powerful laser laser on the cellular membrane infected by hiv whereas these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug
the laser goes through the cell while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds
before you even figure out the hole is <unk> immediately
today we are testing this in vitro technology or in petri dishes but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body applying it to the human body
how is that possible you can ask
well the answer is through a three head device
with the first head that is our laser we will make an incision on the site of infection
the second head which is a camera is headed to the site of infection
finally the third head a <unk> that goes up the drug releases it directly into the infection whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open
well this does not seem a lot of time
but one day if it has success this technology can lead to the total eradication of hiv
yes a cure for hiv
this is the dream of all hiv researcher in our case a laser treatment
thank you
in the last decade i have been looking at armed groups not state military organizations like terrorists insurgents or militias
document what these groups do when they are not shooting
my goal is to understand better to these pharmaceutical agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to non violent confrontation
i do work in the world of politics and in the library
understanding these groups it is key to solve almost everything in course because war has changed
it used to be a dispute between states
no
now it is a conflict between the states and actors and actors
for example of <unk> peace agreements between 1975 and 2011 <unk> would signed between a state and a non governmental actor
so we have to understand these groups we even have to engage them or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution
but how do you do that
we need to know what motivates these organizations
we know very well the reasons why they are doing it but nobody analyzes what they do when they do not fight
the military struggle and policies are not connected
it is all part of the same organization
we can not understand these groups not much less <unk> without a global view
armed groups today are complex organizations
for example the lebanese lebanese known for his violent condition against israel
from their creation in the 1980s <unk> has also established a political party a network of social services and a military device
similarly the palestinian hamas known for their suicide attacks against israel also runs the gaza strip from 2007
so these groups make more than just shooting
they are multitasking
they set up a complex machine communication engine radio stations television websites web websites and social networks
and here they have the printed isis magazine in english and published to recruit
armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising facility without looting but by using profitable business for example construction companies
these activities are key
they allow these groups to increase their strength increase their funds to recruit better and build their brand
armed groups also make something more they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services
they build schools they run their hospitals they put in professional training programs
<unk> offers all these services and more
armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state does not provide security and protection
the rise of the taliban in a afghanistan torn out of war or even the beginning of the promotion of isis can be understood we also looked at the efforts of these groups to deliver security
unfortunately in these cases security has an elevated price for the population
but in general providing social services it means filling a vacuum in a <unk> gap by the government and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power
for example the electoral victory of 2006 palestinian hamas can not understand without recognizing the social work of the group
it is a really complex scenario even in the west when we analyzed the armed groups we just think about the violent side
but that is not enough to understand the strengths of these groups the strategy or the long term vision
these groups are hybrids
they grow because they fill gaps left by the government and emerge as groups and armed groups participate in violent struggle and governance
and the more sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations we can do less we can make it as opposed to a state
how do you call a group like <unk>
they dominate a part of a territory running all their functions collect the garbage run the sewer system
it is a state it is a rebel group
or maybe it is something else something new and different
and what is isis
the lines are <unk>
we live in a world of state states without state and hybrids and the weaker they are states like in the middle east today and they fill that gap the non governmental actors
this is important for governments because to counteract these groups you will have to invest more in non military tools
fill that vacuum of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach
this is very important also to establish and put peace
if we understand the armed groups we will better understand what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to non violence
in this new dispute between states and non state military power can win some battles but we will not give us peace and stability
to achieve these goals we need long term investments to fill that vacuum security vacuum to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning
thank you
i am a failure as a woman and as a feminist
my opinions about gender equality are <unk> but i am afraid to accept the feminist label would be unfair for feminist
i am a feminist but pretty bad
and therefore i am going to tell you as a bad feminist
or at least i wrote an article and a book called the bad feminist and then in interviews people started to call me the feminist feminist feminist
so what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a deliberate provocation has become something bigger
let me take a step back
when i was young about everything in my youth and the 20 years i had strange ideas about feminist these women who were disappointed with men and they hated sex as if that was wrong
today i see how women are treated in the world and anger in particular it seems a perfectly reasonable answer
but at the time i was worried about the tone that i was using the people when i found that it could be a feminist
it will be labeled as a feminist was an accusation a bad bad word
i am going to tell you as a woman who does not follow the rules that ask too much with high self esteem and dare to believe that it is equal to a man
nobody wants to be that rebel woman until you realize that it is actually that woman and you can not imagine being another person
over time as i went growing i started accepting that i am in fact feminist and also proud to be
for me certain claims are women equals men
we deserve the same paycheck for the same job
we have the right to travel around the world as we will be able to go out of bullying or violence
we have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services
we have the right to decide about our bodies without the need for legislative controls or doctrines
we have the right to respect
there is more
when you talk about the needs of women you have to consider our other identities
we are not just women
we are people with a different body expression of gender religion and sexuality and social condition and much more
we have to realize these differences and how they affect us in the same way that matters what we have in common
without this kind of inclusion and feminism is nothing
to me these truths are obvious but to be clear i am a disaster
i am full of contradictions
there is a lot of things that make me a bad feminist
i have got another confession
when i drive to work i hear music rap <unk> all volume
even though the letter degrades women and offends me deeply the classic jumped from the yin yang <unk> <unk> it is amazing
do it with your wet shirt
bitch just move until she hurts the she will
think about it
pure poetry right
i am completely mortified by my musical style
i really believe in the work of man who is all i do not want to do including all domestic tasks but also killing insects the garbage collection the care of the grass and maintenance
i do not want to have anything to do with that
pink is my favorite color
i enjoy the fashion magazines and the beautiful things
and i can see the <unk> and the romantic comedies and i have dreams of <unk> fairy tales that are actually made
some of my crimes are more <unk>
if a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband is his choice and i am not who to judge
if a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children i accept that choice as well
the problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they choose
we will fix this problem
i rejection conventional feminism that has ignored or activated historically the needs of women's women the gay workers and transgendered women in favor of white white middle class
listen if that is good feminism i am a very bad feminist feminist
as well as a feminist i feel a lot of pressure
we have this tendency to put yourself feminist on a pedestal
we hope that we are going to get it to perfection
when we were doing that we retire with a lot of taste from the same pedestal where we put them
as i said i am a disaster i already consider myself from that pedestal before i try to put myself there
too many women particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector are afraid to be tagged as feminist
they are afraid to stand up and say yes i am a feminist for fear which means that label for fear not being able to achieve with little realistic expectations
take an example to <unk> or like i call it the goddess
over the last few years it is a <unk>
in video music <unk> <unk> she was crying in front of the word feminist of three feet tall
it was a magnificent show to see this pop star embracing feminism and to know women and young men who become a feminist is something to be proud of
past the time cultural critics started psychological debates if you were going or not exactly a feminist
let us <unk> their feminism instead of just believing the word of an adult and mature woman
so we demanded perfection of feminist because we are still struggling for a lot we need so much we need a lot
we go far beyond the sensible and constructive criticism to prepare the feminism of any woman to tear it up until there is nothing left
we do not need to do that
evil feminism or more well a more inclusive feminism is the point of starting
but what happens
we have been able to recognize our imperfections to give up the action and it will be a little bit more brave
if i listen to music degrading i am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing an unlimited supply
these artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change actually affecting their profits
it is definitely hard
why has their music that will be so <unk>
it is hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice
but when the bad decisions make it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality the equality we all deserve and it is our responsibility
i think of my nieces three and four years
it is two girls and brilliant and brilliant and also very brave i want to grow up in a world
where you are really aware of the strong creatures that are
i think of them suddenly the best option looked like something much easier to do
we can all make better decisions
we can change the channel when a television program is to treat sexual violence against women as a sport <unk> the game
we can change radio stations when we hear songs that treat women like nothing
we can spend our money to go to the movies elsewhere when the movies are not treating women more than the decorative objects
we can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as boxing
in any case men especially male white men can say no i am not going to publish in their magazine to participate in their project or work with you until it does not include a number of enough women so much to participate as to make decisions
i am not going to work with you until his publication or their organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people
those of us who are <unk> but invited to participate in these kinds of projects we can also empower them to be even more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to decision making
because we are not groupers <unk> without these efforts without embracing these positions our accomplishments are going to mean very little
we can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions get to the top to the people in the power directors and directors and movie producers and music ceos people who can take big decisions more brave to create a lasting and significant change
we can also tell them with courage and feminism well bad or anything
the last line of my <unk> book says i would rather be a bad feminist feminist
this is true because of a lot of reasons but i am telling you about everything because my voice was stolen and feminism was helped me <unk>
there was a incident
i call this incident to address what happened
a few kids i am told when i was very young and i did not know that kids can do this to a girl
they treated me as if it was nothing
i started to believe that it was not anything
they stole my voice and after all i did not dare believe that i could say something that might matter
but he was writing
and i went back to <unk>
i am going into a stronger version of myself
the words of those women who could understand a story like mine and women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin
the words of women who showed me that it was not anything
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write like myself
i found my voice again and i started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure
through the script and feminism i also discovered that if i was a little brave another woman you might hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are
in a hand i have the power to achieve anything
and in the other i hold the humiliating humiliating reality that i am just a woman
i am a bad feminist as i am a good woman i am trying to improve my way of thinking what i say and what i do without leaving everything that makes me human
i hope we all can do the same thing
i hope we all can be a little bit brave when you need to be a bit of a courage
just after christmas last year children in california had measles if i was visited disneyland or to be exposed to someone who had been there
the virus then went through the border with canada infecting over 100 children in quebec
one of the tragic things in this outbreak is that the measles that may be fatal for a child with a multi dimensional immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world
there is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century but many of the kids involved in the disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly even worse autism
but a moment was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and egyptian vaccines all of the beaten and tagged by being a deliberate fraud for the british medical journal
they do not believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines because autism is stupid
i think most of you know but millions of parents around the world continue to pretend that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism
why
here's why
this is a graph of the autism estimates of autism in time
for most of the 20th century autism was considered a very rare disease
the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to develop all their professional life without seeing one case
for decades the prevalence estimates were still stable just three or four children per 10,000
but then in the 1990s the numbers started shooting shooting
fundraising organizations like <unk> <unk> are defined by autism as an epidemic as if i could catch another child at disneyland
what is going on
if you are not vaccines what is it
if you ask the people at the center of <unk> in atlanta what is going on they tend to be based on sentences like criteria of diagnostic and expanded and better detection of cases to explain these growing numbers
but that kind of language we do not pollute a lot the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his two year old child contact
if the diagnostic criteria had to get a lot of a scale why they were so tight at the beginning
why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s
five years ago i decided to find the answers to these questions
i learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and cautious science that with the seductive power of storytelling
for most of the 20th century the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health
there was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic literature
this second story tells us all about how we got here and where do we have to go
the first story starts with a child psychiatrist leo <unk> at the johns hopkins university in 1943 <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like inhabit private worlds <unk> people around their own parents
they could have fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces but they were blind to panic by <unk> as when they do not put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them
on the basis of patients treated in their <unk> clinic speculated that autism is very rare
by the 1950s as the main world authority of the world i figured out that i would seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome while you would pick up reference from places as far as south africa
this is actually not surprising because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism was very <unk>
for example we will give that diagnosis to children with convulsions but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism
he once <unk> that he had turned to nine from every 10 children sent out for other doctors to their office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism
<unk> was a smart man but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold parents and <unk>
these kids said they have kept very carefully in a fridge that is not <unk>
at the same time though i noticed that some of their young patients had special skills to cluster in certain areas like music math and memory
one of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned the two
when her mother put one of his favorite records he correctly said beethoven
but <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like kids were just saying what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval
as a result autism became a source of shame for families and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well becoming invisible to the world in general
remarkably it was not until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in london thought that the theory of mothers <unk> from <unk> was pretty stupid
she and her husband john were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called a susie
<unk> and john knew how hard it was to raise a child as a susie with no support services no special education and without access to other resources without a diagnosis
to defend the national health service that they needed more resources for autistic children and their colleague named gould they decided to do something that should be done 30 years before
they conducted a study of prevalence in autism in the general population
<unk> a suburb of london called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community
what you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited because the fact of autism was much more colorful and diverse
some kids could not speak at all while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics in the dinosaurs or the genealogy of <unk>
otherwise these kids did not fit in nice pictures and <unk> as he said he said and they saw a lot of them much more than the monolithic model of <unk> would have predicted
at first they were lost by trying to make sense of their data
how nobody did not realize these kids before
but then i found a reference to an article published in german in 1944 the year after the <unk> article and then he forgot buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember
<unk> knew about this article of competition but i avoided <unk> in his own work
there was not even an english translation but luckily the husband of <unk> spoke german and he translated it to her
the document offers an alternative story of autism
his author was a man named hans asperger's that i ran a clinic integrated with a university school in vienna in the 1930s
the ideas of asperger's for teaching children with learning and learning were even a lot for contemporary standards
the morning in his clinic they started with exercises with music and kids followed their games on sunday afternoon
instead of blaming the parents of causing asperger's asperger's described as disabilities <unk> in life that required forms compassionate support and spaces during the course of life
instead of treating kids in their clinic as asperger's patient called them his little teachers and he got to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them
fundamentally asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts and disability
he believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been looking at aspects of this continuum in archetypes known in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and <unk> professor
he was beyond even to say that for success in science and art one of autism is essential
<unk> and judith found found that he was wrong that autism was <unk> so that the parents were the <unk>
in the next few years they worked in silence with the american association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called autistic spectrum
by the end of the 80s and early 90s their changes came in place in place the limited model of <unk> by a broad inclusive <unk>
these changes did not fell into broken bag
incidentally when i was going and judith worked in the back to reform these people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time
before he came out rain man in 1988 just a little circle <unk> by experts i knew what autism was but after lemon acts of dustin hoffman as christie <unk> and the rain recognition man with four awards of academia man psychologists teachers and fathers knew what autism was
at the same time we were introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism
i should not have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son
the combination of rain man changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect a perfect storm of consciousness of autism
the number of diagnoses started to rise to the same that they predicted <unk> and named <unk> they were expecting that so it was able to be able to make people with autism and their families finally support the support and services they deserved
so andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by increasing diagnostics a simple powerful and seductive history of history as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
if the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one in 68 children in the united states are in the spectrum is correct autistic are one of the largest minority groups in the world
in the last few years autistic people have joined the internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to solve by the new medical advances <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition
a way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems
the fact that a pc does not work with windows does not mean it is broken
according to autistic standards the normal human human brain is easily <unk> social obsessionally and it has a attention deficit to the details
no doubt autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them
70 years later we are still reaching asperger's which creates the cure for the most autism aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers teachers with capacity support communities and parents with faith in the potential of their children
an autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said we need all the hands on deck to <unk> the boat of humanity
as we are navigating to an uncertain future we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society
we can not afford to waste a brain
thank you
